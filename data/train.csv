1,"   Yeah , that'll convince someone to vote for your guy . Douchey activists support douchey candidates . There is no good or functioning socialism . It doesn't matter how many times you try , or how much smarter you think you are . Socialism always leads to hell . Always . Next .","Bernie is the Democratic frontrunner The polls are wrong This is primary season not passive Democrat season Most dems will stay home and the activists will pick Bernie  Every single Democrat I know in the real world is completely checked out at this point . They're not paying attention , at all . Anecdotal , so take it for what it's worth . i agree , thats what my friends are saying . The activists will vote in bernie  Dude ... I'll be forced to vote Trump if it's VS Bernie . I mean ... they are all going full socialist , but Bernie is true Venezuela through and through . I'd rather see Fake Bernie , Warren ... cuz at least she is just pretending to be Bernie and won't follow through on ruining US .   No he's not you absolute dullard .

0,"  Sunny Leone and Mary Kom are professionals in there own professions . . I respect both . You just don't need to be successful , mature or in sense to project affection . . What do you need ?

If we need a start , they are providing it in hand . Why not to grab it ? . Lord Krishna was present everywhere , but he was nowhere . P . S . Just grab the laddoo on the table & eat it ?  I am still trying to wrap my head around it . What exactly are u implying ? Gosh I feel so dumb now ...  It's a start of ' love ' , be Krishna . Not Shakuni ! ! . . Think ahead . Always .  No dear . This isnt love . Even I have frirnds in JNU , the studious types . I know how much these people love each other and what the hostel becomes If u meet someone from JNU , do talk to them . U will be shocked at the audacity of these "" Students "" .  Stand for the cause , make your cause successful . . Who they're ? How they behave , isn't my concern . I'm concerned about the objective . Objective is PDA should be uplifted .  I think it does matter . Remember , a great business Idea can be rejected and an average idea can be invested in solely based on Presentation . If we choose the example wrong , the effects may backfire instead of influencing and opening minds .  I mean , take this example , If u want to signify a Hardworking , Independent and sincere woman , u choose Mary Kom as an Example . If Sunny Leone is bought in to portray it , the outcome will be completely different from the expected . So choosing the example is important ."

1,"  You call this hieroglyphics ? Don't underestimate how varied language can be , this #4chan is probably far from what hieroglyphics really represented . Except the good of #kek I guess . #kekistanfinito ","It's not that the world is broken . It's that people are distracted from their lives by the images of their lives . Their parents were dream addicts too . We have made culture more important than biology , felling forests to build churches , turning teenagers into desk clerks . Why ?The answer is simple : we have confused the human desire for transcendence with money . The Protestant work ethic says that those who God has favoured will be materially successful . Financial enlightenment is billionaire status : transcendent level of the work ethic . It's a logical but unexamined conclusion : if god likes you a bit , you are rich . If he loves you a whole whole lot , you have billions . Transcendental wealth is the desire to experience god in money . No god yet ? Better try making some more money . Searching for infinity in coin .Making money as a spiritual practice is the unholy hybridisation of the Protestant Work Ethic and New Age movement . The search for enlightenment and the search for billions have unified in the western environment . But money is finite , and god is not . The money path never ends .We have to separate the urge to make money from the urge to know god . Money is finite and is used for finite , satisfiable goals in the material world . The impulse towards transcendence cannot be pointed at physical things without disastrous results . Light within . Work without .Consider this image . It exists to portray a certain kind of man at the peak of his aliveness . It is , in essence , a religious image . We all know this stuff . We know people paint the face of god on products to sell them . The question is , why does it work on us , even when we know ? The answer is that our brains are so primitive that we VERY SLIGHTLY think these images are real . We evolved in an environment without cameras and printers . Why would we have evolved defenses to being programmed by image to do what is bad for us ? Advertising is brain hacking . Memes really are dangerous , and the worst of them are so fundamenral they have overcome our biological needs : "" language is a virus . "" An entire wing of our civilization is dedicated to stealing your resources through brain subversion . Make a list of the people who profit from it Wrong . Memes are a form of communication through symbols , just like hieroglyphs in ancient Egypt . Only those in the know can get the meaning . Language is just a tool , not communication . The most advanced forms of communication are symbolic and telepathic ."

He is objectively a very good linebacker and if you feel better about yourself dropping that kind of hot take man , do your thing . I ‚Äô m not saying he isn ‚Äô t good , I ‚Äô m just not here for the top - 10 adoration he ‚Äô s garnering right now . That ‚Äô s your opinion . He has had a remarkable season by every objective measure so I don ‚Äô t really know what to tell you .  He ‚Äô s done exactly what Derwin James is getting so much credit for but better Bri I ‚Äô m not with you on this one  I get he ‚Äô s had a good year , etc . etc . ‚Äî I just don ‚Äô t see the top-end athleticism that people talked about pre-draft .

I didn ‚Äô t see any top end athleticism talk for him and people labeling him with that isn ‚Äô t his fault and doesn ‚Äô t change what he ‚Äô s done  Takes great angles , and has awesome instincts , especially for a rookie . I just don ‚Äô t see that reactionary athleticism when I watch his tape .  Whether he has it or not it ‚Äô s not impeding him tho so idk why someone saying he has it hurts him to you  I ‚Äô m saying that top - 10 LBs have it .

Unless you want more degenerate debauchery reflected in our culture I suggest you slow your role young'un .   unless you want chinese style censorship in the west i suggest you slow your role old one   The irony is , these are the same people who look at Islam and their censorship of women and think they are backwards just like they think of Chinese censorship .. and they dont see the irony in calling for the same style of censoring .   Never once have I advocated Censorship in this thread but ok . üôÑ LOL   When you cant even take the time to read your own tweets ... üôÑ    You cant even read period . Where in all of that do I say we need to ban porn ? You're just another illogical SJW aren't you ?"
1,   Don't worry kids . Myron Ebell has set the prime minister straight on this today .,""" They told us not to breathe in deep breaths . "" Child on #r4today . Failure to protect health , govt must tackle diesel incl private cars . because diesel pollution even from euro 6 vehicles is very very damaging to health . What about pollution from petrol engines or even from hybrid / electric cars ? Dust on tube bad too ( full of iron ) ? but the huge increase in diesel use is the main driver of acute pollution worsening . Hence focus . Which pollutant are we talking about ? As a trained engineer I'm sure you can be precise :) diesel worse for NO2 , PM10 & PM2 . 5 . Obvs petrol worse for CO2 which is why need shift to public transport walking / cycling .

1,"   Collins you really are a Nazi apologist , funding the IRA in WW2 . 6 million Jews , 5 million Slavs , 3 million Gypsies butchered in concentration camps or starved to death . I can't think of one moral reason Britain fought the Second World War .","Don ‚Äô t use my son ‚Äô s death , and his and his colleague ‚Äô s photos - to promote your vile propaganda . Jack stood against everything you stand for - hatred , division , ignorance .  I'm sorry for your loss , but useful idiots like you will be the downfall of western , liberal democracy . How vile and unkind . Frankly I ‚Äô d rather see the likes of you eliminated from our society - it would improve it no end .  David A is absolutely correct . Mr Merritt is evidently trying to rationalise his son's death by denying what he knows to be its true cause .  I don ‚Äô t care whether he ‚Äô s correct or not . Anyone with a shred of decency would refrain from insulting a man whose son has just been murdered .  If it's correct , it's not an insult . Mr Merritt had the option to keep his thoughts to himself but , chose to embark on a political campaign .  I would not call a grieving father a ‚Äò useful idiot ‚Äô . Mr Merritt ‚Äô s plea for the right wing press not to use his son ‚Äô s death to further their agenda is hardly a campaign . Your lack of compassion is sickening .  Blah blah blah . You keep your head buried in the sand , you useful idiot .  Very rational . Think you just lost the argument there with your ad hominem . Typical Tory .  The Koran is the last word of the Prophet . Islamic Scholars state it is not open to modern interpretation . Which means that if you do not adhere to the literal word of the Koran you're damned and will never enter paradise .  So what ? Bible-believing Christians also claim that unless you are born again you will not enter the kingdom of heaven . What thin , weak argument you use to try and disguise your hatred . Not wasting any more of my time on you , you can ‚Äô t reason with stupid .  How many knife brandishing , bomb making , murderous Anglicans , Catholics , Baptists , Mormons , and Coptics can you point to ?"

Might be a few bricks left to construct your dirty protest room  Not the most effective rebuttal to his point about building walls ...Because it's not about "" walls "" it's about effective border control .     Germany has 3621km of borders . I guess it would a job creation scheme , albeit not a very productive one   very true . I reckon it would be relatively easy to do it   cross the border that is , not patrol every road ! !   Are u lot so daft to think that having good border control stops communication and cooperation ?   you can invest in inefficient border controls or efficient intelligence / police work . Simples .   Money doesn't grow on trees , nor does it grow on the side of red buses .   Not to mention you're not taking into account the immense benefits EU economies get from Schengen   How much better off is average Joe since the borders went ? Business benefits most   this isn't really controversial.The principle was demonstrated by Colbert in the 17th century   The same Colbert that supresed working men and banned workers from leaving France ?"

1, Left should probably keep attacking the centre left rather than looking at the bigger issue . Party is bigger than country after all buddy .,"Horrific McCarthyism : agreeing with an extreme hard right blog that the left should be purged from public existence .

Should the left reflect on a terrible election defeat , including scrutinising the leadership's failings ? Yes . But there's nothing extreme about wanting tax justice , investment , public ownership or free education . There is about allying with the hard right to purge the left .If we're saying the media should platform voices according to each party's share of the vote , then where will that leave people who style themselves as being in the centre , given the Lib Dems won 11 % and won less seats than 2017 ?

1,  Then it would be more obvious ! üòâ Instead better to let the political editor of the BBC take the fall !

0, Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ‚Äô s Eve !,"1 . I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù .2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ‚Äô s just ‚Äú business as usual ‚Äù for Suleimani )3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : 8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : 10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ‚Äô re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .11 . But among the ‚Äú menu options ‚Äù that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . 12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to  for insight . He ‚Äô s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ‚Äô s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ‚Äô posture in Iraq15 . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s all been downhill , ‚Äù  told me , in terms of America ‚Äô s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ‚Äô s trying to downplay Suleimani ‚Äô s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga ."

I wish my fellow Americans understood that not everyone behaves like Americans .   They have been killing non-Muslim for 1000 ' s of years and direct attacks on Americans since Carter #CONSEQUENCES OVERDUE   And Christians have been killing them for thousands of years .

It ‚Äô s why the screwed up college system we have hits home for me .  For when you have an opportunity . If states with lax food safety laws resulted in anywhere from 3-7+ times the number of food related illness and fatalities than states with stricter laws , what would you suggest someone who wanted to reduce incident ( systemically ) rates do ?  I would start systematically banning categories of food . Starting with leafy vegetables since they cause the most incidents . Shut down every privately owned restaurant and only have government cafetarias . Also seize all farms .  Wow ! As this is your background , please elaborate .  That was sarcasm . Just trying to be more like you .  If you want a serious answer I ‚Äô ll give you one . And since I believe in voluntary interactions please leave it at that . Educating about production line issues and source of contamination . Pointing farmers towards resources for education . Educating on safety and cleanliness .  And if after the education , you didn't see a marked improvement ?  Hold individuals accountable . Punish individuals accordingly . Incentivize testing and testing standards . Make testing cheaper ( we do this ) . No law will be followed by all . As evidenced by production facilities being shut down even though we have already strict protocols in US .  Agreed . Ideally , but not realistically , we can't reach all . Do you believe regulation helps ?  As a side note . ‚Äú Ugly ‚Äù produce doesn ‚Äô t get wasted . It goes into animal feed , sold at cost , or goes into things like tomato sauce .

0,TASK Deliberately look for someone / a group of people and solve a need of theirs . As you do may GOD Almighty solve a problem of yours in Jesus name . #charity #compassion #Jesus Glory to GOD ¬© Tonte Eke-Spiff Like my page .  Instagram ,"PRIORITIZE CHARITY Merriam Webster defines charity as the act of giving money , food , or other kinds of help to people who are poor , sick , etc . #charity #compassionThe heart of GOD towards humanity is love . Therefore , charity should be expressed with a heart of love and of compassion to another . #charity #compassionI encourage you to develop a charitable lifestyle not for self aggrandizement but for the need to save a dieing soul . #charity #compassionCharity is simply just an act of love being expressed . So in your relationship with people and in whatever you do make sure you priotize charity . #charity #compassionAnd above all these things put on charity , which is the bond of perfectness . Colossians 3:14 KJV Unknown to you , when you engage in charity you are actually meeting the needs of GOD . #charity #compassionDo not wait until you have excess before expressing love . You can still engage in charity In your own little way . Remember charitable deeds differ from individuals because financial status aren't the same accross board , so engage within your reach . #charity #Jesus"

1,"  üôÑ that's "" right "" only those with money should be allowed to join any political party , if they're poor they should be denied a voice in the political party they support , the poor are unworthy of having a say for the crime of being poor , in fact disallow the poor a vote","This is quite a painful thread for me to write . But it needs saying . We've just lived through a period in which many charged with protecting British Jews have done the exact opposite . I'm referring here especially to the Chief Rabbi , Board of Deputies and Jewish Chronicle .Completely in the face of the evidence , a narrative was created by the media , and doubled down on by those I mention above . This narrative blamed those who can always be found on the front line fighting AGAINST all forms of racism for antisemitism .At the same time , as antisemitism on the right and far right rose , rose and rose some more , the response was ... nothing . Nothing whatsoever . The organisations and individuals I've referred to above simply DO NOT CARE about most Jews . That's what their record shows .And as they do not care about most Jews , the following is likely to happen : 1 . Any attacks such as the latest awful ones will be blamed on the left , regardless of reality . 2 . This will cause ever more panic among British Jews .3 . If any left wing Jews are attacked , heaven help them . Because as their record proves , those whose responsibility it is to protect them will do not the slightest thing . 4 . Antisemitism will continue to rise from the far right : whose existence is being normalised .Don't expect the individuals and organisations I mentioned in the OP to magically come to their senses . THEY DON'T CARE . Least of all about anyone poor , disabled , vulnerable , or left wing .Already , we've seen an online campaign to somehow blame these latest atrocities on the left . Already , we are seeing absurd , revolting attempts to paint Bernie Sanders as an antisemite . This will only get worse . The only cure is education and solidarity . #NoPasaranWhen Michael Rosen - MICHAEL ROSEN ! ! - is persistently attacked and smeared for the crime of caring with all his heart for all his fellow Jews ( and for humanity itself ) , what's going on here couldn't be clearer . Not least when the person insulting him is followed by blue ticks .The past 3 years or so have seen the most hysterical , disgusting campaign of smears and lies I have ever known in British politics or British public life . That's not going to magically stop now . Facts no longer matter . Evidence no longer matters .Those responsible for this are interested only in the following : 1 . Attention ( in the case of celebrities ) 2 . Clicks and newspaper sales ( in the case of the Jewish Chronicle ) 3 . The defeat of the leftNone of them are remotely interested in the defeat of antisemitism . They couldn't be less so . And you know how I know that ? Because Britain has a prime minister who personally profited from antisemitism for YEARS ... and these organisations rejoiced in his victory .The House of Commons , meanwhile , has a leader who has repeatedly propagated horrendous antisemitic tropes ; as has the prime minister's special adviser . Again : none of them say a single damn word .The Jewish Chronicle has been referred by IPSO for sanctions due to its false , evidence-free demonisation of a Labour activist , after an investigation with which it refused to cooperate . This is far from the first time it's been in trouble either .And the Chief Rabbi himself makes an outrageous intervention into an election campaign to inquire about Britain's ' moral compass ' ... while the poor get poorer , disabled people take their own lives , and austerity claims hundreds of thousands of victims . Under the party he backs .Sam Kriss refers to all of this as the war against the Jews . He's right . And what he had to say should be read by all . But as Sam Kriss is a left wing Jew , for these people and these organisations , he's therefore the wrong kind of Jew . Or even , a non-Jew . Because goodness knows , voices like his , Rosen's or so many others must at all costs be drowned out by nonsense and hysteria .Down this road lies absolute catastrophe . When so-called civilised societies abandon evidence , abandon reason , abandon any sense whatsoever of community , solidarity or the ties which bind us all , catastrophe is always what results .And when it does , those responsible for this disgusting campaign will , I'm sure , continue to blame the left ... even as the left does everything in its power to help . Orwell and 1984 , eat your heart out . ü§∑ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è Labour opened its doors to any crank & thug with ¬£ 3 in his bin , gave them all a vote & ended up with the cranks in charge . Until it puts this right , it will be blamed for the consequences . It ‚Äô s not * hard *"

0,"   It has been a wonderful sharing example of how brilliant #Twitter can be - they may be only 10 ish of us BUT put together a group that covered everything ... experts ( JP ) , Governors ( NK ) , HT's and teachers - . If you love it #keepit If you don't ask away","Right , sensible question now #EduTwitter . Reduce workload and data drops to 2/3 per year = üëç check But also have data management system so that Governors know we are monitoring progress = ü§ù ? ? ? Excell spread sheet ? Something else ? What works in your schools ?  Have you asked your governors what they need to evidence progress ? Have governors seen the strategies being utilised ( are they visible ) ?  Agree with this . Personally I don't want to see data which isn't already existing . Because that demonstrates how you monitor progress .  Agree , wholeheartedly with this , time is precious and should be used wisely .  If you weren't already collecting the data because it wasn't helpful to you , then it is definitely of no use to me . Don't feel you have to go and do something different . Far better that an explanation of the data you do have is given to us .  I've been a governor myself since 1995 . Mostly I'm keen to know what systems are available that achieve both purposes .   If it works for the teaching staff it will work for governors . I imagine Excel spreadsheets are easiest for everyone on both sides ? Maybe setting up via Google Docs . Sorry if your thread was diverted a little but I ‚Äô m passionate about teacher workload and data , hopefully you ‚Äô ve got the answers you were looking for .

I love my but would never ask anyone to change if they love their current system . Having data tasks has got to be enhancing as opposed to a chore - all the recommendations will be spot on and the proof is in the pudding   Systems need to be easy to use , customisable , capable of storing all data a school needs in one place . Schools should not have to make compromises to fit rules of a system . Teachers should be able to easily access any data on children .   And data for governors needs to be simplified . Too much data is dumped on governors without much strategy . Many systems provide governors access ( good thing ) but thought needs to go into what reports they use .   Think an explanation of the data is as important as the data itself ."

1,"  Ok , let's get a few things correct . Your claiming I got triggered for being called dishonest while ignoring how you got #Triggered for being called out for it . Disagreeing is one thing , making ridicules claims you cant back up are another . And now you run away #lolz","1 . no one is criticizing the calling of porn ‚Äú immoral ‚Äù . 2 . porn is protected speech ; you ‚Äô re arguing for limiting speech you don ‚Äô t like . That ‚Äô s what Leftists do . 3 . if the govt is daddy & can tell you what you can & can ‚Äô t watch , then what ‚Äô s the argument against total daddy govt ?  You can do what you want for yourself . We just don't want our kids to have ready access to it on their personal devices , let alone content pushed to them without even looking for it . And just like you lock your guns up , you lock their access to porn . It ‚Äô s on the parents , not the government .  It's so weird to see so many right wingers now calling for more government control when not to long ago they wanted to make government smaller .  We have govt control around anything extremely immoral . Murder for example . Plenty of right-wingers supporting that .  And ? Are you trying to say porn is like murder ?  Nope - but you insinuating I might be is fairly disingenuous . Let's just chat , that shouldn't be too hard . Govt regulates things that are extremely harmful to society . Porn is exactly that . You want to hurt yourself ? Fine . But let's stop making it readily accessible to minors .  It has nothing to do with the discussion which is why I asked . You havent proven porn is harmful once . You keep throwing out that claim acting like it's TRUE . And even worse , now claim i am harming myself somehow and acting like porn is available to minors when it's for 18 plus  So please dont tell me what is and isnt disingenuous when you've done all those things in your tweet . If you want to believe porn is harmful . Fine , that's your opinion . But stop stating it like it's a fact when you've yet to back that claim up .  It has everything to do with the discussion . Govt regulates harmful ( incl . immoral ) things , esp . for minors . Not a controversial claim , but it obv . made you feel defensive - and in turn flippant : "" ArE yOu TrYiNg To SaY iT's LiKe MuRdEr ? ? "" 1 /  You don't agree it's harmful ? That's fine , you can simply say as much without getting angry : "" I disagree about the useful affects . Many studies show the exact opposite . "" See ? That's not so hard - for someone who's being honest . 2 /  At any rate , us "" right-wingers "" believe it IS harmful - mostly to the spirit . Which is why scientific studies are so mixed - they can't quantify it exactly . 3 /  But SUPPOSE we're right , just for second . Then it would make sense for govt to regulate it like other serious things . Maybe with an outright ban , like murder ; or maybe with regulation , like alcohol . Maybe it's ok for adults , but we need to keep it away from minors . 4 /  Point is , t's not a "" weird "" position to have - we simply disagree . If it triggers you so badly to have someone disagree with you , then further discussion is pointless . I'm going to enjoy my Sunday ; but feel free to shout your anger into the wind . / End"

I'd say they were gains rather than losses , but I had to abandon cost accounting as a career because I couldn't understand balance sheets I consider myself in the black .

1,  ooo the what about the #ToryElectionFraud episodes we don't hear much of them do we ...,"I'm utterly mystified Labour hasn't raised alarm about Tory proposals on ' voter ID ' for elections . It is designed to hit Labour votersTories have dressed it up as saying it will ' crack down on voter fraud ' - without much evidence for it . But this isn't JUST about minoritiesNo doubt ' voter ID ' will make it harder for ethnic minorities . But it will also restrict students and poorer people - those who vote Labour !The ' voter ID ' plan is straightforward voter suppression , using ethnic minorities as foil . Yet Labour silent . Unreal "

0, Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ‚Äô s Eve !,"1 . I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù .2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ‚Äô s just ‚Äú business as usual ‚Äù for Suleimani )3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : 8 . It was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one US official , chose the Suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that American intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . They scrambled to locate him , says the official .9 . According to the official , the strike on Suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the US was not sure PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was in the convoy . He was also killed and is also viewed as an Iranian proxy : 10 . Since the strike , Iran has convened its national security chiefs . Chatter intercepted by American intelligence indicates they ‚Äô re considering a range of options . Cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and American personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .11 . But among the ‚Äú menu options ‚Äù that I had not heard before were : ( 1 ) kidnapping and execution of American citizens . ( This might explain why the State Department has ordered the evacuation of all US citizens in Iraq , not just government and embassy employees ) . 12 . Another is attacks on American diplomatic and military outposts not just in Iraq , Lebanon and Syria , but as far afield as UAE and Bahrain . The official I spoke to was particularly concerned for American troops stationed in Iraq , some of whom are co-located with Shia militias13 . How does this impact the war against ISIS ? I turned to  for insight . He ‚Äô s studied Iraq since the 1990s . What he told me is that months before the strike that killed Suleimani , the tensions with Iran had already degraded America ‚Äô s ability to fight ISIS in Iraq :14 . In 2019 , America has been denied airspace and access to operations in Iraq to go after ISIS at the behest of Iran-backed groups . The US has also been told to stop communicating with Sunni tribes . These are important setbacks that have already weakened the US ‚Äô posture in Iraq15 . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s all been downhill , ‚Äù  told me , in terms of America ‚Äô s access to the ISIS battlespace in recent months due to Iranian pressure on Iraqi officials . One upshot ? US special operations forces have been on the offensive in Diyala , Nineveh and Kirkuk provinces16 . A likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out-of-the-way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . Fighting ISIS is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the US embassy is being attacked .17 . Before I go back to the pool let me just say the obvious : No one ‚Äô s trying to downplay Suleimani ‚Äô s crimes . The question is why now ? His whereabouts have been known before . His resume of killing-by-proxy is not a secret . Hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga ."

I could see a suspension , but losing top draft picks for two years is what crosses the line for me .  Yes you have to hit the ball and pitch but hitting the ball is far easier when you absolutely know what's coming . Pitching isn't just hitting spots and having good stuff ... it's about keeping batters off-balance and making them guess . The guess-work was gone .  Then change up signs . If teams continue to go with lazy 1 , 2 , 3 then they deserve it . Also , I've heard from plenty of hitters who wouldn't want to signaled mid at-bat or mid pitch . So much whininess about unwritten rules , etc . Just win , and don't make excuses / exhaust all options ."

1,"   Besides , Wisen ‚Äî whose own church doesn ‚Äô t have open books ‚Äî encouraged / told other HBF men to ‚Äú move on , ‚Äù not take ‚Äú swings at the bride of Christ , ‚Äù & coach others to ‚Äú follow our lead . ‚Äù This is a faux moral high road that plays into the secretive $ culture . Blech 2/2 ","Here are my top 10 stories from last year . I ‚Äô m amazed at all God revealed and accomplished through this blog . And I ‚Äô m grateful for every source who entrusted his or her story and information to me . This was a team effort !  I still don ‚Äô t get this . HBF was a subsidiary how ? According to who ? It had a diff board , no ? Also , why didn ‚Äô t anyone fight HBC 1 on HBF donors behalf ? Instead Wisen ,  ,  et al took the pseudo-spiritual high road of silence on theft of donor funds ü§®    The HBF board was there only in theory , according to my sources . HBF was under the HBC elders who had no idea what was going on .   I ‚Äô m not trying to be difficult , but what does ‚Äú under the HBC board mean ‚Äù ? Are the sources saying that HBC 1 ‚Äô s board was secretly the boss of HBF ? The sources ‚Äô use of ‚Äú subsidiary ‚Äù makes it sound like there was some kind of actual legal position of authority of one over the other   It wasn't secret . According to former HBF director , Gordon Zwirkoski , James very clearly articulated that he wanted HBF brought under HBC & the HBC elders . HBF allegedly ceased to be a separate 501c3 and became an auxiliary of HBC . At least , that's the narrative .   When does Mr Zwirkoski allege that happened ? What year ? Unless he says 2017 , financial statements , the IL SoS , and the IRS conflict w / his narrative , as far as I can tell . With these various "" open "" EINs , I have big concerns about theft & money laundering   He can ‚Äô t attest to it happening . In fact , he opposed it and that ‚Äô s why James fired him . No one seems to know for sure . My guess is only Fred Adams and James know ‚Äî and maybe Steve Huston . And maybe they kept separate orgs for the purpose you suggest .   knew . Seems pretty clear here . Also , HBF was renamed Vertical Church Network in Feb 2018 , per IL SoS , and uses the same EIN as HBF , it appears .    Yes , but the confusion was how it ‚Äô s a 501c3 but not a separate legal entity from HBC . Can ‚Äô t remember the term . Auxiliary something .   Integrated auxiliary . My current understanding is that if it were an integrated auxiliary , would have / should have noted it here . I can ask a NFP accounting expert .   Probe your NFP expert . I confess this is a new term for me .   See here  Also , here's a screenshot from the final HBF audited statements by I see no lack of clarity here about what HBF was as a legal entity . If it was an IG of HBC , then why didn't CC say so ?    Moreover , HBF transitioned into VCN ( same EIN and IL corp file number ) . No one is asking if VCN is an integrated auxiliary of HBC , and no action was taken for it not to be . Why ? Because HBF wasn't a IA , in my opinion   If it wasn ‚Äô t an integrated auxiliary as Harvest leaders claimed , then HBC stole from HBF . If it is an IA , then what happened cannot be stealing because HBC & HBF we ‚Äô re legally the same .   Right . More importantly , it means HBC stole from HBF donors . Has any HBC leader , current or former , ever told a straight , complete story when it comes to money or real estate ? Even the folks who aren ‚Äô t ‚Äú lying ‚Äù don ‚Äô t ever seem to have the full story .   When it comes to HBF , Harvest withheld info from those conducting the financial review . Even Wisen didn ‚Äô t know for sure whether HBF was an integrated auxiliary or not . I couldn ‚Äô t get a straight answer from Harvest about the board . Just a hot mess . GCC should ask for $ HBC owes .   I replied here . Seems to me that the entity relationships are made crystal-clear . I ‚Äô m also not seeing that HBC owes GCC anything . HBC owes donors to HBF , which may include $ given to HBF by the church plants .     Almost all of HBF's budget was from the independent Harvest churches that comprised HBF . When James disbanded HBF , those churches formed GCC . So I think GCC has a right to the $ . Or , the approx 150 churches could seek reimbursement individually , but that would be vry complicated   GCC as an entity wouldn ‚Äô t have a right to that money , in my non-lawyerly opinion , b / c GCC didn ‚Äô t give the money & was formed ex post facto If the stolen money was directly from churches giving the 5 % franchise fee to HBF , then the churches could perhaps band together & sue 1 /"

I'm white and not racist . And I happen to be related to some Olympic-level racists . Unless that is just considered a rude gesture in another country I don't get it . If it was considered racist or offensive , ignorance of that fact does not equal racist . Racism is the thought that one race is better than another based on the virtue of them being different . Behaving in a racist way includes : telling racist jokes , using slurs in a derogatory way , treating somebody of a race poorly or differently only because of their race . There's nothing wrong with that definition except in how's it applied . If I'm standing in a group of black guys . One tells a racist joke about black people . Everyone laughs , including me . They aren't racist , but I am . That's the double standard . Perhaps I didn't find it funny ... Right , the double standard is always a fun one to talk around . That's part of how intent defines it . They were arguably in that situation laughing at the stereotype not the content of the joke in a belittling way . Granted , I've never been called racist at all ... Recently I saw a writer called out for describign a POC character's eyes as exotic . Definition : originating in or characteristic of a distant foreign country . That word alone is now considered racist . But only if the writer is white , AKA preestablished intent . See , I'd never see that as racist . If the writer in their narration passage called a POC character a slur , Idc what color the writer is , that to me is racist . Using "" exotic "" as in "" not of my homeland "" seems like just following the dictionary definition . As I mentioned in the rest of my thread , a slur can also be unintentional . A writer may do their research , but they can't help the reactions of trigger happy people who like to call everything racist . It's often the color of the writer who is mostly on trial , not the words . The word spelled : T-R-A-P is considered a cosplaying slur . I learned because of an angry outburst screaming over me & not hearing me ask what the PC term is . I meant to refer to a character type . Not to demean people . Words identify things . I still don't know the PC word ."

0,"   To be viable post #Scexit , Scotland would need an additional 500,000 taxpayers , which means attracting companies . As Scotland is already the highest taxed part of the UK , you propose further increasing the taxes which means business and immigrants won't come to Scotland","   Scotland was incredibly rich in 2014 . We still are wealthy . I don't see your point   Not a Spanish btw . Well aware of EU rules   In which case you should know why theoretically , a #Scexit ravaged Scotland would struggle with meeting the criteria . ‚Äú Wealth ‚Äù - I presume is you refering to dwindling oil reserves and growing renewables . You allude ro SME so you know that is only part of the requirement .   I know that we currently meet all of the criteria because we are already a member , so our transition back into EU should be fast and easy , according to Jean Paul Junker . I ‚Äô ll just take his word for it thanks   Junker has nothing to do with it , you don't meet the criteria on so many points , but you know that .   ah ok , where is Scotland's Central Bank ? , just one of the criteria that we don't meet .   Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Hungary , Poland , Romania , Sweden ( and UK ) don't use the euro .   and only Denmark and UK are legally allowed to remain outside of the euro permanently . This is by treaty negotiation and means that iScotland on joining has to agree to join the euro at some point in the future . A requirement is a central bank .   I'm sure well be fine the world doesn't revolve round your Brit pound , what if Scotland leaving the UK will impact the value of it .   Scotland leaving will have virtually no negative effect and potentially a positive one over time . The rUK retaining the additional funding that was paid to ScotGov will have a beneficial effect on rUK economy . Your mistake is thinking the Union is about money .   That's the mistake of the unionist . So let's hear what's more important .   Yes we often make mistakes quoting facts at you nationalists . Many have advised me that it's a waste of time and with your responses here I'm beginning to believe them .   Gers is the No1fact that's given to me fair enough , the problem is these figures are calculated within the union , these figures will change when Scotland is Indy Do you want Scotland to live with a deficit taking from the English economy the rest of its days . That's not good ‚û° Ô∏è   GERS gives Scotland the figures on the last day of Union and first day of independence . From that day the accounts must be managed by SCotGov , this means expenditure must equal income . Would you raise tax by 20 % , cut public spending by 20 % or mix of both ?   Would you like some more time on this one Baz ?   A mix of both leaning more towards tax increases . We'll manage"

Yes , because the majority of migrants are unskilled , therefor driving wages down for low skilled Brits üôÑ  No evidence of that . Unbridled capitalism much easier to prove as cause of stagnating wages #NoBrexit No , it isn't . Too many low skilled workers chasing the same job drives down wages .

Employers who were advertising prior DROPPED salaries . üôÑ And you blame migrants . You're unfit to be a teacher ( if you are , not likely a troll ) #NoBrexit I don't blame migrants at all .

1,"   awful world we live in , huh ? Presumption of innocence is just sooo terrible","   We don't know that . There is no context in the video . The posting of the vid is a celebration of the violence   Context : the world we live in . What's more likely ; a girl in a headscarf picking on a boy or vice versa ?   The posting of the video was supporting and praising violence by the girl . It is NEVER right to hit anyone .   Self-defense has to be proportional to the threaten , therefore no context = no self-defense   if a tree falls in a forest , and no one is around to hear it ..   you're saying that because we didn't see the white boy tugging at her hijab , it couldn't have caused /   justified this . I . E , the tree fell , we didn't see it , does the sound ( context ) really exist   you're also following the same oppressive rhetoric of "" PROVE you were harassed "" as if a   muslim woman having her hijab tugged is the strangest thing in the world - as if the white boy , based on   body language , isn't very much active in the fight . As if you aren't feeding into painting black   women as "" angry for no reason "" . But like , y'know . Cook   That's just so dumb . First , context doesn't equal "" oh I need to see that to believe it "" , context can   be provided in many ways . In this case context wasn't on the video nor the tweet ( because honestly   if you take the "" i wish i had done that when they pulled my scarf "" as a context what the girl did   was way too far from self defense ) . Second , that tree thing is just absurd since "" context "" is given   by the fact that the tree's on the floor , just like you can prove an agression even if none saw it   with other kind of evidence besides eye witnesses . And I'm so sorry If I believe in presumption of   innocence , but yeah If you get to acuse someone of something you have to prove that's true . What an"

1, i ‚Äô ve been physically assaulted coming out of the women ‚Äô s washroom by men for that very reason - their ridiculous fragile notion that we are somehow a threat .,"The fight over trans rights has ignored a key group : pro-trans feminists . Here , leading feminist thinkers told BuzzFeed News why feminism should include trans people . One of the problems with biology , when discussing feminism and trans people , is where it leads , said Prof . Akwugo Emejulu . ‚Äú This has always been the dark heart of white , feminist politics : a jealous guarding of the boundaries of who gets to be a woman , said Prof . Emejulu She cited several examples of white feminists excluding women from ethnic minorities , but began with the earliest . This continues to the present day , she said . ‚Äú Boundary making is what ‚Äô s crucial here . ‚Äù Therefore , she said , excluding trans people is a way of keeping one ‚Äô s position or status . Keeping trans women out is , Prof . Sally Hines said , ‚Äú regulating who can belong to a category in order to close down membership , in order to protect the rights of a dominant majority [ white women ] ‚Äù .Prof . Emejulu & Prof . Vanita Sundaram argue that for feminism to really deliver equality & emancipation , it must also focus on problems women face as a result of oppression on basis of factors other than their sex : in particular race , class , sexuality , disability , & gender identity . Prof . Sundaram : ‚Äú My own research area is violence vs women & girls , and we know that trans women are more vulnerable to violence , harassment , and everyday abuse than other groups of women . So as a feminist and academic , it ‚Äô s my responsibility to advocate for that group of women . ‚Äù‚Äú So it has to be a feminism that challenges patriarchy and other systems of hierarchy that are used to oppress , gender identity being one of them , ‚Äù Prof . Sundaram . One of the reasons that a war over trans rights has raged more intensely among feminists in the U . K . than in the US , said Prof . Alison Phipps , is ‚Äú the blame has been put on to the wrong group , and trans people are carrying the can for problems that are not of their making . ‚Äù The idea that simplifying trans women ‚Äô s legal recognition would lead to increase in attacks in toilets or prisons was unfounded . Prof . Phipps said evidence doesn ‚Äô t show trans women to be anything like as sexually violent as men ... while instead being even more likely to be victims Painting trans women as predators when they are routinely victims is unjust . And because perceived threat is not the same as actual threat , policies should be ‚Äú based on actual levels of risk , which are low , ‚Äù Prof Phipps ."

I too would also like to know this timeline .   I know there was enough coal for ~ 50 years at Wabamun , but that's toast too .   i've worked enough pilot projects that were funded by the government to know this can work .   currently exist , so we need fossil fuel to get energy . Instead of shutting it down make it better and cleaner .   the number of years left is probably closer to 200 .

1,"   "" What I'm dreading is an earnest , progressive white man's opinion on the story and reaction . ""","So . I've been searching twitter expecting to see some kind of response to Andray Domise being charged with assault . Strange . This morning my twitter search showed lots of results . Searching just now only has 4 , incl yours . and I'm not pretending to know more btw , even though I do know him , or did . But with other cases I didn't need to look , just a stroll through my TL and I'd be awash in people's opinions . The contrast is quite striking to me . Could be b / c he's only well-known within a small community , nobody in that community wants to believe that it's true , and the community also wants to believe women by default . It's kind of nice not to see a lot of conjecture for once . well I'm supposedly part of that community and the double standard is pretty infuriating as far as I'm concerned Human nature playing itself out . I'm having a hard time with my thoughts and feelings on it in the absence of information .  it's bc people only want to call out violence when it's easy for them . Leaving all of us who haven't reported alone .  I could say more about what I know about this situation but I honestly don't have the will to deal .   In addition , saying more may put any past or current victims at risk for whistleblowing .   I don't think people should discuss what they know or give details publicly . It's disappointing   to clarify : I was not referring to anyone else's details but my own publicly   understood . And I don't think you or anyone else should feel under obligation to share info .   Rumours and hushed tones do more harm than good . If people have evidence I'd hope they'd go to police .   I don't mean to dismiss people who don't go to police .   regardless of intent you did , also assumes that police is actually a solution   I know and I'm sorry . What I meant is I hope her case has all the evidence it needs to be successful ."

Why are YOU here ?","   Why don't we just feed them ? He cares but he wants us to do it , we can sort starvation out in a heartbeat but the wickedness of man prevents it . Jesus could come and slap people in the face with a fish for being so stupid , a few weeks later , they'd go back to their wicked ways .   why doesn't the vatican do it ? because they are a hoax , they have self-invented themselves taking advantage of a myth , jesus , to dominate people and conquer territories to gain power and riches , that's the reality of it   I'm not a Catholic , so ask them . I know the good my church does .   I dunno mate , you tell me . Gather up a few atheists and ask them why they lie to themselves on a daily basis that God doesn't exist ?

Have a look what the bible says about bearing false witness , it is a sin to call me a liar when I am not , I am only trying to save you from hell . Proverbs 6:16 - 19    I think you misunderstood his tweet . Look back at it   He said that I say to myself that god doesnt exist , I do not , hat is a deliberate lie , I say I dont believe that god exists , no one knows whether a god exists or not .   Isn ‚Äô t saying to yourself that God doesn ‚Äô t exist and saying you don ‚Äô t believe that God exists , pretty much the same thing ?   No , I dont know whether god exists or not , nobody does , all I know is that I am unconvinced that he exists , therefore I dont believe . Just because I dont believe in god doesnt mean that he doesnt exist , just like you believing in him doesnt mean he does exist .   We can know GOD as much as we are able to know Him , in same way we can know anything . Examine Him . See what He says and does . See & hear & read testimonies from others . Most of all use Truth of what is known to be True to test whatever we absolutely know is True . > >   Bring god here and we'll examine him . Blathering on about god with no evidence that he even exists is not going to cut it .   That ‚Äô s all .. he shows up and we ‚Äô re all believers .. that simple .. instead of us all killing each other in his name , just show us you exist .. is that asking too much ?   Oh ? ! I see . I really do . You want to SEE , feel & Touch Jesus ? So do I ! It seems you will only accept Jesus as you WANT Him to be rather than how he really is . What do u know about who Jesus is ? #c4urself If you u to know Him , then honestly learning FROM Him is best .   Then why are you here ? Step aside . Let Jesus speak for himself ."

Only good Christians get to insult . You don't get to reply , & certainly not with humour & wit .  Six ! We got there in the end . Now , since u don't have any sound reasoned arguments you can piss off . Dismissed  If naturalism were true I'd just b dancing to my DNA . Since you attribute my actions to me , u prove it untrue  All you've demonstrated is how little you understand science . You are an imbecile . You are dismissed .

0,"   Yea , he is . And so is this : no UK-USA trade deal unless the Friday #Agreement is protected , which means the 140 areas of cooperation that are overseen by the all-island intergovernmental institutions .

It's not that hard to understand . They've got 11 months to put a good enough deal on the table , or we leave without one .  Your attitude articulated exactly why Northern Ireland ‚Äô s relationship with Ireland was not passed to Phase 2 talks .  Ireland pre-emptrd voices like yours and persuaded the other EU26 to prioritise NI so that you wouldn ‚Äô t use the threat of harming the #Friday #Agreement as a rouse to secure a trade deal that hurts the EU Single Market . Smart , weren ‚Äô t we !   The UK will not continue a Single Market with the EU   Yes we know , #Brexiteers keep telling us .

1,   Exactly Bill Clinton was Impeached The Senate allowed him to stay on the job ; but he forever will be impeached . ( Notice how no one on the left has ever denied it ? ) Trump now joins the ranks of Clinton . I guess the difference is that Clinton was brave enough to testify .,"  Articles of impeachment not sent to the senate yet ! AOC wannabe   He ‚Äô s been impeached . That happens by the house . They voted . It ‚Äô s done . The senate votes to convict and remove . Read a little hon .   And the Senate won ‚Äô t hun . Do the numbers .   But he is still Impeached . No matter what the Senate does , he will forever be an Impeached President . Kinda like when someone is convicted of robbery . Doesn ‚Äô t matter if the judge sentences them to 10yrs or probation . They are still a convicted criminal no matter the punishment .   Just like Bill Clinton , right ? Donald Trump will still be our President ."

0,   Why not ! The thinks Hillary has superhuman abilities to survive capture on every front of [ alleged ] wrongdoing .,"Worth repeating . The testimony & evidence considered in a Senate impeachment trial should be the same testimony & evidence the House relied upon when they passed the Articles of Impeachment . Our job is to vote on what the House passed , not to conduct an open ended inquiry . No . You're 100 % wrong . A Trial requires : ‚Ä¢ Evidence ‚Ä¢ Witnesses Your job , Senator Rubio , is to be an * impartial * juror .  So does an indictment , and yet the House chose to pass the Articles anyway . Both things also require a crime , which was also lacking in the whole thing . They alleged a crime in the beginning , but then never included that crime in the Articles .   Which came first : the Constitution , or the USC ?   Does it matter if neither Abuse of Power nor Obstruction of Congress are codified as criminal acts ?   Yes it does matter that they are not crimes . Obstruction of congress is part of the duties of the executive branch . And abuse of power is so common , as well as a matter of opinion ( in most cases )   I think you misread my post . I was responding to the "" which came first "" question with my answer . It doesn't matter which came first as those things aren't crimes , so should not be the basis of an impeachment ( included with crimes , sure , but not stand alone ) .   Violation of the emoluments clauses is explicitly impeachable , which provides a practical bribery test , in the Constitution itself . By that very reasonable standard , bribery was committed .   There's a very good reason they didn't include a violation of the emoluments clause in their Articles : Trump donates all funds gained from foreign governments at his properties to the US Treasury .   Receiving them is the violation . You've got to apply being a stickler both directions .   Nope . Benjamin Franklin received a gift from some European country , France , I think it was . Congress then declared that he could keep it . Congress can't make a decision about whether a government agent can keep a gift unless the gift is known , which is after it's given .   Gifting , particularly among governments , are not hecessarily spontaneous , and a strict reading of the Constitution calls for prior consent of Congress . Congress makes decisions about things that haven't happened yet all the time . It's what they actually do for a day job .   No , that's not the way it's ever been interpreted precisely because most gifts are not known of ahead of time . But you're right about Congress making decisions on things that haven't happened yet . They decided in 2016 to impeach Trump for something that didn't happen until 2018   GOP shouldn't beat that horse . They were after Obama from day one , impeachment ( you may recall "" that's change I can believe in "" t - shirts ) , make him a one-term President declared for the record by #moscowmitch on #Senate floor , or just by hook or crook .   But how many times did they actually try to draft Articles or open an Impeachment inquiry ? I can't find any . Some Democrats tried to draft Articles 3 or 4 times prior to this , mostly based on tweets Trump sent .   Trump didn't suddenly become an authoritarian man-child who would be king . Decades of visibility there . America allowed a person who has operated within his businesses with absolute authority to become president of a democratic republic . That amounts to implanting a cancer .   Trump isn't an authoritarian man-child now . No , Trump is not a cancer . Put down the FakeNews before you have a stroke .   That's all he is , nothing more . Well , #putinpuppet fits in there somewhere .   Ah yes , the disproven Russia angle . So is Trump an evil genius that can evade detection by 4 federal investigations into ties to the Russian government ? Or are you a "" useful idiot "" for keeping up the conspiracy that the media peddled for years and Mueller said didn't happen ?"

You're exaggerating somewhat , but finally getting the message . It's innate human behavior to want to destroy the strongest . Out of your conscious mind's control .  It is a human weakness to make so many excuses . I find it weird and disturbing that you have become so sycophantic to believe that level of conspiracy . I wonder what your character flaw is to so desperately need to buy into that belief .  You think you know what you're doing but you don't .

Its telling that this is all you guys can criticize about him   I have a question for you as well . A few actually . Why was Cenk kicked out of the Justice Democrats ? Why is he being sued for racial discrimination ? Why did it take him so long to admit the Armenian Genocide happened ? Why does he think certain types of bestiality are ok ?   0 policy questions and 4 stories that have been extensively addressed or taken out of context .

He is a disgusting , arrogant and carpet bagging douche . He is unfit for office .

Just as we did upon news of the Allies ' victory in 1945 , let's celebrate our new-found independence ! Find out more ‚¨á Ô∏è the church of england is so left wing and politically correct today that there is more chance they would ring their bells to pay respects to a dead terrorist than to support an important national occasion like Brexit .  If you think the CofE is left wing , you're in for a shock when you meet its founder ... ( Jesus , in case you thought I meant Henry VIII ... )    What nonsense . Church of England was founded by Henry VIII because Pope wouldn ‚Äô t grant him divorce . Re-writing history is totalitarian . The whole organisation is based on hypocrisy . To say otherwise is blatant denial of the truth .   John Every system and every model of behavioral governance is a human construct And every human has hypocrisy as a character trait Your glass house is missing a few windows ...   Eh ? You know nothing of my beliefs . Are you denying Henry didn't start his own church because RC church wouldn't grant him a divorce ? & make himself & his heirs & survivors head of that church , a role present monarch fills ? History books I've read wrong then ?   The original tweet was about Jesus . We won ‚Äô t worship Henry VIII . Your point is not relevant .   But Jesus didn't start Church of England . In fact Jesus didn't start any church , it was his disciples & followers . His fans in other words .   The church is simply a body of people who follow Christ . The fact the the CofE came about through a historical figure doesn ‚Äô t change the core beliefs or validity .   But the whole concept of it as a separate entity was founded on Henry 8 not getting divorce from Pope . It is a hypocritical sham .

There are journalists who definitely have a leftward slant / bias . But there are many who try their hardest to treat all sides fairly like  and who are looped in as enemies of the people for reporting facts .   But they want to be treated that way when it ‚Äô s convenient . Have you heard anyone in media admit wrongful treatment of Trump ?   what do you mean wrongful treatment ? when papers or stories have gotten stories wrong they printed retractions or corrected the story . is that what you mean ?"

Thanks for everything Kath - and here ‚Äô s to what comes next ! #TeamCroydon,"Today was my last day , after 7 eventful years , as Clinical Lead of the Emergency Department  . My lovely General Manager Ann and the team surprised me with this gorgeous bouquet to mark the occasion . Feeling very lucky to work with such a fantastic bunch of people !   Always a dangerous comment to make as a COO , but ... in 10 years as as an operational board Director , and 24 years as an operational manager / clinician ( I started when I was 14 ! ) , I have never had the absolute honour or privilege of working with an ED leader - anywhere - as  Committed , passionate and just frankly out of this world as Kath .

1, They voted for Trump because they want to roll back on progressive policies that actually benefit them too .," Whereas I'm getting ready to #FeelTheBern P2 ;) Maybe I've gone way too progressive but 2016 has pushed me that way ! Don't drive a political wedge between people.Focus is still the same.Trying to make a better future.It ' s just differing views I'm afraid that Trump's legitimised hate speech and that's going to drive a wedge . Until he apologises the lines are drawn . He did apologise at the debate . What now ? He didn't apologise .. he's got a #MeMeMe complex . I think he has to beg forgiveness . Literally bear his heart and soul . He gave it the attention it was worth . 20ish year old comments that harmed no-one and even expressed shock that they consented Yet his behaviour on the campaign trail backed up the fact he wasn't sorry by any stretch of the imagination . He's a charlatan . Not caring what the press chooses to say about you does not a charlatan make . I think the press gave him more coverage than Hillary and painted him out to be some sort of renegade saviour . Totes Ridic . See you blame Hillary a lot and I blame Trump a lot . Protestors and supporters have similar dilemmas . It will be hard to resolve . No , Hillarys campaign outlined it as part of their campaign to do it . Have the pied piper candidate Was that from the Podesta emails ? I didn't even believe half of them . Whether "" verified "" or not . Guess I just don't like Wikileaks You just refuse to because it doesn't compute with your doublethink . Hillary was a sexist , racist bigot , owned by the banks So it comes down to who you believe . Most protestors believe Hillary . Trump supporters believed Trump . Seems to be an impasse . No , the Trump protestors believe Hillary and Podestas emails not their words . Not every Trump protestor was a Hillary supporter-that's true . I believed Hillary and took her at face value . Simple as that . The election came down to who you believed . Trump supporters overlooked his sexual assault . Hillary supporters didn't . Simples . Hillarys supporters told everyone they were no better than Trump . So they voted Trump"

You can see why that would be foolish , correct ? Because he had no case , as was shown by 0-17 with no hope for appeal . Come on , that is basic , you should know that .   DaGreatOne 8 What was wrong ? Are you saying Ty offered to have Vic pay the defense fees ? Because that is what you are insinuating if you say I am wrong . That would make him more incompetent than I thought , which isn't really possible .   DaGreatOne 8 And yet monica's motion to dismiss the appeal that was filed by ty beard was denied which means the appeals are going through , nice try   DaGreatOne 8 The motion to dismiss was only because it was filed too early . He could have refiled even had it been dismissed , so the appeal was expected . No "" gotcha "" moment there , try again . Though , with the intelligence you are showing , don't expect to get one .

Ask where to look if you don ‚Äô t know .   DaGreatOne 8 Reality is that there is no evidence against vic , no police reports and if it's true and they knew about it why didn't anyone go to the police ? ! Why didn't they do anything about it ? ! Why didn't they stop him ? ! Why did they allow it to continue for an entire decade ? ! ! !   DaGreatOne 8 There is evidence , that is what the depositions are . Evidence . And since no one is being charged with perjury , the court feels they are true . Including Vic , who gave damnable testimony against himself .   DaGreatOne 8 So why did lemon try to depose Chris slatosch then ?   DaGreatOne 8 I knew some speculation about that at some point , but no longer recall what it was they were going to ask him about . So I can't answer that off the top of my head .

Read my previous comment in the thread , for example . I know you struggle to keep up with conversations , but do better .   DaGreatOne 8 You people seem to forget that the case is a "" civil case "" and not a criminal one , so the accusations are just "" assumed "" true ... there's no evidence to back up the affidavits .   DaGreatOne 8 No . None of that is correct . Do you want the real answer ?

DaGreatOne 8 Ok , prove that the accusations are true , and that the women are totally traumatized by the events   DaGreatOne 8 The accusations are true because the court believes the depositions and did not charge anyone with perjury . They are also true because Vic admitted to them . Prove they are not .

1,  actually Jordan is the real imperialist creation by Britain given to the Arabian Hashemites .,"Can any enterprising reporter ask Jordan's king if his country with its estimated 75 % Palestinian population is not ‚Ä¶  would that be relevant ? Surely it is far fetched to expect the Palestinians to head East , whether voluntarily or by force ..  That's not what I meant - - but I think it's just ridiculous to pretend Jordan is not a Palestinian state ..  So creating another Palestinian state on the WestBank & Gaza means there will be 2 Palestinian states ( OK with me if = peace )"

0,  Leaving b4 the Prayer After Communion is said reveals ignorance of the Mass & lack of faith & belief in the true presence . Jesus catechized those who stayed after Capernaum ( Jn 6 ) . Catechize from the ambo on this . Instruct the ignorant . Cute gotcha videos dont save souls .,"When you are leaving Mass after communion but the priest sees you .  I wish priests would recognize WHY people leave after communion . 1 . The return to the pew hassle as people wait for others etc . 2 . They want to stay in their spiritual state and not deal w / others . 3 . The music is just downright bad 4 . They are choosing the "" Better Part "" ."

1,"  LOL ! Bitter and cynical ? Accept human nature for what it is and don't spend time idealizing a failed concept . Here's a question : Are we a democracy OR are we a republic ? Because you insert "" democracy "" like it's some magic word solving all the ills you deem problematic .","‚Äú Capitalism isn ‚Äô t working ‚Äù say people who continue using computers , GPS , Uber , Airbnb , Spotify , Amazon Prime , laser surgery and live on their iPhone People continue to use PRODUCTS , produced by companies that CAPITALIZE , and divide their companies and sell portions called "" shares "" . "" Capitalism "" , the stock market , a scam devised to shift giant blocks of wealth from the bottom poorest people to the top richest , is failing . Global poverty , extreme wealth inequality and the very existence of billionaires are glowing examples of the failures of Capitalism . It's one of the many things rich people would like us to believe we can't live without and at the same time we didn't used to have .  It sounds like your gripe isn't necessarily against capitalism but human-nature . Capitalism best reflects human nature . Socialism fails in reality because humans are mostly greedy and selfish : Capitalists . On paper , socialism looks ideal and workable but falls to the same greed .  DEMOCRATIC socialism works everywhere it's been tried . You guys keep leaving off the DEMOCRATIC like it's poison to you . Pity . Greed exists on Wall St . and in the hearts of the little people who chase dollars , but most people aren't greedy . You're just bitter and cynical ."

0,   You are condescendingly disrespectful and all that is wrong with liberalism that I hold near and dear . I don ‚Äô t support trump but I can defend some of his record . I have been consistent with my angst that the media is doing us a great disservice by not reporting unbiasedly .,"I know a lot of decent Republicans and conservatives in Arizona , who are fed up with the indecency of Trump and elected officials like  who emulate him . Enough to decide the outcome of close statewide elections in Arizona in 2020 .    Why , she said the truth ? Your statement here shows how fake you are . She is the truth teller . Anyone who has watched for decades as I have cannot stand by and call them a trusted news source anymore . They are clearly a constant one sided ideological reporting agent . #truth   She refused to answer a question from the free press . You are siding with open fascism .   What a stupid statement . If not answering the press is fascism what is only covering one political ideology . I think that ‚Äô s probably closer to fascism but I gather you don ‚Äô t understand what real fascism is . It starts out with one side owning the press .   Have you seen Sean Hannity criticize President Trump ever ? Have you seen anyone on Fox News refer to law enforcement as "" law enforcement "" rather than "" Deep State "" ? Has Fox News apologized for known falsehoods about Seth Rich ?   Joelle , if you want to see "" both sides "" you need to know actual facts . The question the reporter asked McSally was whether she would consider new facts at the Senate trial . To refuse to answer THAT question from ANYONE is absurd .   I ‚Äô m not discussing THAT ISSUE . I ‚Äô m discussing the following , I don ‚Äô t want to continue talking to someone who can ‚Äô t admit the simple thing . Journalism is dead . It is no longer an unbiased important estate . It is political ideology and used to be revered . They are now HACKS   Journalism always had and always will involve some bias . There is no such thing as impartial . People have to choose what to cover , what headlines to write . That was certainly true when the first amendment was written .   You were the one who raised the issue of bias when you defended McSally - - who refused to answer an entirely appropriate question - - by following the Trump talking points of attacking the media for daring to ask .   Actually Joelle , you might even agree with this one : "

And that their personnel could not be coached better than any playoff team that is playing now by submission of zero facts to support your opinion .,"   Man , what if he did and what if he won ... what an entertaining season that would be .   He has his hands full keeping the job he has ...   Well you are guaranteed not to do worse , anyone can go 8-8 with that talent . You have to go big with Washington ‚Äô s hire .   All that talent . Ok I have a question ... what nfc playoff team would you trade even for the Dallas roster ? Because it ‚Äô s only Philly . They ‚Äô re not as loaded as everybody says .   So the # 2 QB , # 4 RB , and the # 8 WR to start with ... is NOT LOADED ? What are you missing man ? This ain ‚Äô t Jay Cutler Man Crush is it ?   It ‚Äô s not fantasy football . So which team are you swapping the entire roster for ? None , just like I said . You got sold a bunch oh bull about ‚Äú talent ‚Äù and rankings . But they ‚Äô re not   I make my own evals about talent and brother if you can ‚Äô t make it to the playoffs with what you have in Dallas in the East , you need to be fired . ESP if you have 13 years to do it . Question should be , which coach would you put with the Cowboys .   Still waiting to hear which playoff team this team is more talented than ... so far crickets   I can ‚Äô t believe you feel this is a valid position , however , I ‚Äô ll humor you . The patriots easily are less talented than the Cowboys also you can add Bills , Vikings , and of course the NFC East champs ... all of which the Cowboys should have won . #Takethattothebank   If you honestly think your trade the Vikings for the cowboys roster you ‚Äô re crazy . I ‚Äô ll give you the Eagles . AFC teams aren ‚Äô t relevant but I disagree with the Bills also .   Facts : top 4 defensive teams in playoffs , Dallas ranked # 9 and Min #14 . Dallas total offense ranked in top 10 and all statistical categories better individual and team than Min . #Grind   Facts ... depending on how you sort them . Yardage stats . Heck you ‚Äô re so smart I ‚Äô m surprised you ‚Äô re not a gm . It seems so simple . Too bad it ‚Äô s not that simple . Prob won your fantasy league with this kind of factual knowledge . Did you ?   Sort them every way you want and it still comes out with the Cowboys being statistically better than the Vikes . Too much work for you ? Use something other than Fantasy pokes as your basis .   Ok sort them by points smart guy . Since that ‚Äô s the whole point of the defense is to prevent points . Minn better than Dallas . Mic drop"

0,   Usher puts respect on other artists song whenever he does tributes,"It's widely known  has MJ and Bobby Brown as major influences . But you can also feel the aura of the likes of Prince & James Brown in Usher's art . So my top 3 favorite Usher's songs influenced by Prince : - Mars vs Venus - Do it to me - Lay you down   People are so dumb they want artists that are gonna straight up imitate Prince's voice & technique . What I love abt Usher is that he makes the song his own nd performs it to the best of his ability  Often , artists influenced by Prince don't want to be copycats because Prince himself was an innovator . Therefore , his followers make his sound their own in order to create something new : D'Angelo whole career or JT's FSLS album . It's the same with UR when he channels Prince .  It's like how people are complaining about Bilal &  not being included in the line-up   Maybe in their minds people who mimic Prince and profess loudly their love for him will automatically do good performances . Or they want the 2008 BET Prince tribute all over again ... Anyway , we don't know if other artists will be added . Also , these singers can be unavailable ."

0,  Billy Graham ‚Äô s granddaughter said it best : God judges our entire existence based on how we love Him and how we love other people . And to me that means deeds . Not words . Not believing in silly apparitions or Old Testament tribal mumbo jumbo . #science #tolerance #peace,"Why would God make women so damn attractive if he didn ‚Äô t want me to be a lesbian ?  Why would God say in the bible ( Old and New Testament ) homosexuality is a sin if it wasn't ?  Why would the Bible say a man can murder his daughter if she sleeps with somebody or is pregnant out of wedlock , if he can ‚Äô t ? Modern day rules preventing fathers from killing their daughters are sinful .  If you really want to learn about God , start with researching the resurrection of Christ . If Christ rose from the dead , then no better reason to believe or to worship . If he didn't then Chris is a fraud ."

0," If Saudi was fighting with Yemen , as you suggest , it wouldn't be a proxy war , it would just be a war","I'm not pro-Iran , I'm pro-Iranian sovereignty . As someone that has argued pro-British sovereignty for the last few years , it would be hypocritical of me to do anything else . Any UK position that undermines Iranian sovereignty , is counter-productive to our own sovereignty . It's a shame Iran doesn't recognise the sovereignty of others in the region , instead it uses them for proxy wars How many more need to starve in Yemen before something is done The Iranians would be obliterated by a war with the US , they know it . But they also need to save face Proxy wars , against whom ? Iran isn't at war with Yemen . Saudi Arabia ( with US backing ) is . Talk about a proxy war ! The notion Iran would be obliterated by an ineffective force like the US , against Iran's geography and regional guerrilla experience is laughable . Ok let's start with your first point , yes Saudi is fighting a proxy war in Yemen ... but weird thing about wars , there is usually more than one side üôÑ The other side is Iran  Second point Iran has no airforce and no tanks ... so yes obliterated "

1," Really , And what are you doing now ? If you don't like my reply then you should of thought about that before you replied to my tweet last night . Your debating skills amaze me .","So I was reading this thread on the EI forum ( I ‚Äô m not proud of myself I was bored ) . Anyway this so called punter / white knight / possibly another escort was pissed because this escort called Rafaella got a 4 star review . Not a bad review as 5 stars is the maximum number of stars thatcan be given . So he proceeded to slam the reviewer who is a good , honest reviewer a thing which is in short supply these days , especially on a site like Escort Ireland which is renowned for fake reviews . Anyway the usual suspect saps and irate escort alcoholic Nikita UKproceeded to attack this reviewer and other posters who spoke out in his defence . As the night went and started getting into the wee small hours ( well after 3am ) the posts from the white knights and Nikita started getting more abusive , irate and ludicrous . One post in particularby a poster called funboy 71 had me in snorting out loud with laughter at his logic for giving a bad review . Surely this sap cant be serious . According to him a bad review should only be allowed after visiting the escort more than once , ermmm no I don ‚Äô t think so , a bad reviewcan be left after the 1st visit . A bad review after the 3rd visit would have me thinking does this reviewer have a grudge , the 1st 2 reviews sung her praises , a 3rd review that ‚Äô s bad would stink of revenge to me either because the client is pushy , abusive or stalkerish and theescort doesn ‚Äô t want to see that client again . What followed was a honest review by a honest poster being deleted . Now what I do know is this , in the past this escort has been linked to several other escort profiles and allegations of sharing an apartment with up to 4 otherescorts has been quickly shut down by the same irate mob  Link to thread about the so called bad review , review which has now been removed  The sap came forth and identified themselves . They blocked me after his or her tweet . Took their ball and went home . Well that ‚Äô s your opinion and you are free to express it . I cant tell anyone what to do but I can make them aware of the facts which I have done in my pined post but lets recap . 1.Nikita UK is a self confessed alcoholic 2.Escort Ireland and  know this Are you happy with this tweet ? I used to like you . You are acting like a wanker . Some of the best people in history had a drinking problem . So what ? I am not really fussed if you like me or not . Sure i follow you and you follow me but friendship has never came into it . I am simply telling the truth , now if you cant handle that un follow me . She has displayed abusive behaviour time and time again on both sites . To answer all your tweets & all your replies to me ; Dear Punter 08 , You're not fussed I hear you . But sometimes telling the truth whether it is your truth or not hurts people . If that was your agenda , success . If not think on ... attack everybody but escorts . I'm not attacking anyone and escorts aren't immune from criticism . You are coming across as a sap tbf . Not all escorts are bad , the ones i have mentioned are . Now if you have a problem with that thats fine , but i will not be a doormat for anyone . I'm probably a sap . But there are plenty of escorts that I had issues with but I don't post it all over social media . Just to be clear i deleted the original tweet from my news feed weeks ago about Nikita UK until Oskana , Oxi , Lexie Minx , Mia purple moderator for  the so called american with the eastern European grammar brought it up again . So if she was going to tell lies about it i was going to post the truth and if that meant posting the screenshots to disprove her then that is her own fault not mine . And as far as hating someone which Nikita UK is now crying about i dont hate anyone especially someone i do not know . Thats just stupid and Nobody is discussing anything with you . You are just ranting ."

We got brexit , we want May to ignore Parliament . Hmmmmmm .  Parliament GAVE the decision to the British People .   that wasn't what parliament said , and you know it .  2nd reading of Ref bill where It was made EXTREMELY clear who's decision this was . Read FULL   could you highlight the stated agreement by all concerned showing agreement ?  Bill was commended to house & passed by a maj of 6-1 In Parliament , Read FULL , Quote for People NOT Parliament 2 decide .   You need to learn Law & the Constitution Lawyers for Britain , Ref Is Binding  Now , you need to behave and not be so patronising . I expect you have already criticised courts / judges . Y / N ?     am afraid the ref is not binding , DC didn't set it up this way . Also EU is only one part of Europe .   Endorsing the point that ref not binding . Take it as ye wish   No Government has EVER Ignored a Ref result & NEVER would , It would be political suicide .   BREXIT 3 things wrong : 1 ref advisory , 2 no plan for a brexit vote , 3 EU is only part of structure 1 /   1 , Ref was Binding , 2 blame Cons 4 no plan ( arrogant enough 2 think they would win ) 3 UK Is leaving EU   u can say it as often as you like the ref is not legally binding . I agree UK needs to leave EU . UKIP 1 /   Ref Is constitutionally binding & will be Implemented of that there Is no doubt    Disagree . but think it will be implemented . Gina will make sure the law is upheld and parliament have the vote   Parliament will not get a vote on deal , all that will happen Is a bill will be passed to Invoke art 50 yes , what an amazing step having fought for parliamentary sovereignty .

0,"   So true . TiVo was a great product , but very few watched TV like I did ( 3 VCRs & 15 tapes . ) Not enough people saw a reason to change the way they watched TV .

TiVo has always made my living room so much more fun .","I can't imagine a thoroughly enjoyable TV experience without  or a hard drive-based DVR . There will not be an aggregating service that allows us to save , in the cloud , any show from any channel or service for ( far into the ) future viewing . #TimeShifting     Not to mention the viewing experience is so much better . Skip , FF etc .   So you ‚Äô re both saying the CEO , cc-ed on this thread , is making a strategic mistake by wrapping the TiVo experience around the Sling TV cloud streaming service at the expense of soft TiVo Mini apps ?   Sounds right . It's not a good decision for me . Although ... I can see Apple not wanting TiVo on their box . I can see Android not wanting that either . FWIW , the Apple TV app stinks .

1,"   Source it if you like . As if we think for ourselves anymore . Ask siri , maybe . Got some original rhetoric you want to share ?","   This is how it affects middle NZ , essentially . The key factor , though , is that those earning 100,000 plus aren't remotely impacted - these taxes hurt the bottom end . It's a hate tax on low income workers . Which is why both Nats & Labour ( every party , in fact ) are fine with it .   thats bs . The ones on 100k + pay double the tax and donate WAY more ... you are sadly deluded . Thats a scarcity and jealous mentality showing The arguement should be why do the govt waste so much money . What we earn should be what we keep in the majority no matter what you earn   Correct , the more you earn the more you ‚Äô re taxed , over 100k earners are taxed at an unfair rate of 33 % which takes a huge chunk of your salary .   Sorry earning over 70k is taxed at 33 % so if you ‚Äô re just over 70k you ‚Äô re better off earning in the 60s because your tax rate is only 10.5 % so your take home is higher   60s is 30 % i think . 48g up . 48g is SFA , so that's stupid high . Coalition should've moved brackets , but they're tax-mad scum .   Yes 48k to 70k is 30 % which should be lowered to 17 % 70k & over is 33 % which it should be raised to people earning over 150 to 33 % 70 to 100k should be 17 % as well   why should people earning more pay a higher bracket , they are naturally going to contribute more anyhow ? How is that fair ? Thats greedy ...   Look at govt spending , as percentages . It's a simple subsidisation process , kept in motion by valued lobbyists . Revenue take & spend is published regularly . Do your research & pluck out what suits your narrative , as everyone else does . "" Follow the money "" , as we're regularly told .   you did not address my question as to why higher earners should have a higher tax bracket , you are deflecting ...   Progressive taxation has been a simple aspect of fair societies ( in developed world ) for many decades . Egalitarianism promotes wellbeing in societies , which generates higher local spending , healthier GDP & limits public upheaval . Look around you . The peasants are revolting .   is that some sort of copy and paste ?"

0,   Winner ! Great job Kurt ! You proved the point that firing JG is not the solution for the Cowboys . And that their personnel could not be coached better than any playoff team that is playing now by submission of zero facts to support your opinion .,"   Man , what if he did and what if he won ... what an entertaining season that would be .   He has his hands full keeping the job he has ...   Well you are guaranteed not to do worse , anyone can go 8-8 with that talent . You have to go big with Washington ‚Äô s hire .   All that talent . Ok I have a question ... what nfc playoff team would you trade even for the Dallas roster ? Because it ‚Äô s only Philly . They ‚Äô re not as loaded as everybody says .   So the # 2 QB , # 4 RB , and the # 8 WR to start with ... is NOT LOADED ? What are you missing man ? This ain ‚Äô t Jay Cutler Man Crush is it ?   It ‚Äô s not fantasy football . So which team are you swapping the entire roster for ? None , just like I said . You got sold a bunch oh bull about ‚Äú talent ‚Äù and rankings . But they ‚Äô re not   I make my own evals about talent and brother if you can ‚Äô t make it to the playoffs with what you have in Dallas in the East , you need to be fired . ESP if you have 13 years to do it . Question should be , which coach would you put with the Cowboys .   Still waiting to hear which playoff team this team is more talented than ... so far crickets   I can ‚Äô t believe you feel this is a valid position , however , I ‚Äô ll humor you . The patriots easily are less talented than the Cowboys also you can add Bills , Vikings , and of course the NFC East champs ... all of which the Cowboys should have won . #Takethattothebank   If you honestly think your trade the Vikings for the cowboys roster you ‚Äô re crazy . I ‚Äô ll give you the Eagles . AFC teams aren ‚Äô t relevant but I disagree with the Bills also .   Facts : top 4 defensive teams in playoffs , Dallas ranked # 9 and Min #14 . Dallas total offense ranked in top 10 and all statistical categories better individual and team than Min . #Grind   Facts ... depending on how you sort them . Yardage stats . Heck you ‚Äô re so smart I ‚Äô m surprised you ‚Äô re not a gm . It seems so simple . Too bad it ‚Äô s not that simple . Prob won your fantasy league with this kind of factual knowledge . Did you ?   Sort them every way you want and it still comes out with the Cowboys being statistically better than the Vikes . Too much work for you ? Use something other than Fantasy pokes as your basis .   Ok sort them by points smart guy . Since that ‚Äô s the whole point of the defense is to prevent points . Minn better than Dallas . Mic drop"

1,"  Here are my two favorite quotes that reflect Cenk's views on women , "" the only reason you would not want equality for women is if you are an incredibly weak man "" and "" if you were a woman and didn't have equality , wouldn't you be angry ? "" Sure sounds misogynist to me","The Cenk blog thing is an instance of petty cancel culture being weaponized and I don't like to generalize typically but should now be evident we won't tattle-tale our way to power .Here's my double standard for problematic speech : Standard 1 : I don't like what a person has said . Standard 2 : That speech corresponds to how that person has been approaching their work or exercising power . Standard 2 is when I start invest attention , politically . If you don ‚Äô t get that how someone speaks is a direct reflection of how they most likely operate , then you ‚Äô ve had a privilege that not many women or POC enjoy . Sorry I don ‚Äô t think a man has any right to decide what ‚Äô s offensive to women . ü§∑ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è"

0, What an incredible about Mary so thrilled she is so well now . What amazing work you have all done in CUH a miracle expert team if professionals . Hats off to you all ! üéâ üéâ #miraclescanhappen #care #dedication Wishing Mary & family a full and very happy life üíå üíå üíå,""" Mammy's not well "" 5 year old Priya has FaceTimed her Dad , Damian , using the family iPad . Damian is on his way to work . It's been a busy few weeks for the family . His wife Mary , 35 , is at home with their daughter and new 2 week old baby , Noah . It's two days before Christmas .Horrified , Damian sees from the iPad that his daughter is holding , that his wife Mary has collapsed to the ground . She is not moving . She can't speak . He quickly calls family members who live next door . They race to the house , calling an ambulance along the way .An ambulance arrives . The paramedics suspect Mary has suffered a stroke . Within 15 minutes they are on the way to CUH . They pre-alert the Emergency Department and the CUH stroke team , who are waiting at the door as the ambulance arrives .Mary is seen immediately by the Emergency Medicine and Stroke Teams together . She has suffered a catastrophic stroke . She can't speak . She can't swallow . She can't see properly . She is paralysed down her right hand side .Advanced imaging shows that Mary has torn her left carotid artery , the main blood vessel bringing blood from her heart , through her neck to her brain . Worse still , she has also blocked the left middle cerebral artery - the main blood vessel with the brain itself . Mary is critically ill . There is no blood getting to the left hand side of her brain . At just 35 , this stroke will either kill her or leave her with severe disability , requiring nursing home care . The chances of her returning back home to her young family are no more than 5 % . But , Mary has come to CUH - the busiest inpatient stroke centre in Ireland and 1 of just 2 hospitals in the country , that can provide stroke thrombectomy - the ability to acutely remove the blood clot causing the stroke . Mary is immediately prepped for an emergency thrombectomy .Consultant Interventional NeuroRadiologists Dr . Gerry Wyse and Dr . Noel Fanning , along with their team , quickly rebuild Mary's torn carotid artery using 3 special stents . They then remove the blood clot further up in her brain . She has been in hospital less than 1 hour .Mary is transferred to the Stroke Unit under Consultant Neurologist , Dr . Aine Merwick . The team , and Mary's family wait to see if the procedure has been clinically successful . Within 24 hours , Mary can speak again . Within a few days she can wash and dress herself .Within a week , Mary has no discernible stroke deficits . She can walk and talk , eat and drink , laugh and cry . She leaves hospital a little over a week later , stopping on the way with her husband Damian , to again meet the team that saved her life . I was't directly involved in Mary's care but I am enormously proud of the skill and dedication of my colleagues here in CUH who were able to save her life . She came to our hospital , our stroke service , at the most critical time in her life and received emergency care that iscomparable to any hospital in the world . There hasn't been any clinical intervention in medicine within the last decade as effective as stroke thrombectomy . Uniquely , for medical advances , it is also hugely cost effective , with large reductions in rehab and social care costs .We have performed 77 thrombectomies in CUH in 2019 , a 50 % increase on previous years . We have treated patients from Cork , Kerry , Tipperary , Limerick , Waterford and Clare . We have had many outcomes as good as Mary's , albeit few as dramatic .We still have work to do to further develop CUH as a comprehensive stroke service with a properly equipped and staffed stroke unit that can provide comprehensive stroke care to the people of Cork and Munster , every hour of every day , every day of the year . We are making progress .Mary is back at home with her husband Damian and her now 5 week old son , Noah . Her daughter Priya is back playing on her iPad . ( An enormous thank you to Mary and her family for giving us permission to tell her story ) ."

IMO I just think he'd be the best to pull this country back to some sort of sanity & our allies already know & trust him . That's crucial . It's his last chance too , others have more time ... just my opinion   I agree with Natalie . I want Biden as well . He can hit the ground running . Voting no matter what though .   Hit the ground running huh ? HaHaHa There ‚Äô s only one candidate young enough to do much running & thats but like my besties who I ‚Äô m responding to #IWillVoteBlueNoMatterWhoToo cause we gotta get rid of Trump & flip the Senate ‚Äº Ô∏è   LOL Jason . Don't get me wrong I LOVE Pete too but he's got years to run again & in the meanwhile learn . BTW , I've seen Biden run & he's got the stamina PLUS , he's the one Rump is most worried about for some reason . Could be he knows something we don't , JS   I'm a fan of Pete's but realistically the candidate needs 2 win PA , MI & WI . Biden's a shoe-in ( grassroots Homie ) 4 PA . MI & WI Catholics will vote Biden . Plus , he'll likely take states that Hillary won.This all puts him in 1st position for a win . ? ? ? #votebluenomatterwho   Wow , you laid that out perfectly . I'm feeling it big time !   Spread the word ! We'll all vote blue but Joe's our best chance to beat Rump if he's not indicted at the polls !   I find it interesting how my female friends are rightly appalled when a Republican male behaves piggishly but to the last one are willing to look the other way , are forgiving , will discount Old Joe ‚Äô s creepy behavior toward women & girls as no big deal . What happened to #MeToo ‚Åâ Ô∏è   Uh , if you want honesty ... I don't think Joe is creepy in any way . His mother taught him to embrace everyone . Show them that he cares , so he does . He didn't grope anyone . A grope and a light hug are not the same thing . By the way , as a female and I have never been a fan of MeToo .   I want to believe your version of Joe ‚Äô s truth but we must prepare for the opposite . There are tons of photos out there that can be read both ways . Will women when bombarded by TV commercials that highlight them AND a booming economy think the best of Joe or the worst ?   Our country is in shambles . We need to reverse a lot of stuff and that requires someone who is already ready to be president . Trump is absolutely the last person in the Milky Way galaxy who can talk crap about anything . Mr . I slept with a porn star while his wife was pregnant .   AND don't forget he wasn't even wearing protection ! That alone proves what a slimeball he is & what little respect he has for his wife ! He could've gotten anything from her & passed it on , SMH ! ! He's a PIG ! ! !   Y ‚Äô all assume he was still having sex w / Melania when he did Stormy ? People assume ( who knows ? ) Melania got pregnant without the help of a fertility specialist . None of this makes Trump any less of a pig but still , much hasn ‚Äô t been revealed nor ever will . He ‚Äô s sadly still winning .

0,   Very of my ancestors for coming up with a religious tradition specifically designed to make theologians cry .,"The Anglican position on infant baptism is unequivocally Augustinian : salvation is applied to ALL infants in baptism . Doesn't matter who you pull from , Cranmer , Parker , Jewell , Hooker , Ward , Andrewes , Davenant , Ussher , Overall ... you can go on for days .Of course , faith must be chosen later in life , but even then the baptism imparts grace that pulls one towards that faith .  Well , precise pinning down of election isn ‚Äô t really a thing for classical Anglicanism . The BCP and Articles predate the Armenian / Calvinist debates .  Right , but now we are living past those debates so we need to be able to refine our language to dialogue with modern questions .  It ‚Äô s like living after Nicea and being like ‚Äú well x church ‚Äô s tradition predates the Arian controversy so they really don ‚Äô t have a developed Trinitarian theology ‚Äù  Except that ‚Äô s one is an issue of heresy and the other is an issue of intra-Reformed doctrinal precision . My argument is that such precision isn ‚Äô t as necessary for our tradition as some would have it . As an Anglican I don ‚Äô t have to choose between TULIP and Remonstrants .  Yeah the Nicean thing is an exaggerated example , but in light of Scripture don ‚Äô t these questions have to be answered ?   I don't think post-reformation English church has a definitive position beside what is described in the 39 AOR / BOH anyways . Reformed & remonstrant coexist uncomfortably to this day   Nowell ‚Äô s Catechism : M . What is the secret and spiritual grace [ of baptism ] ? S . Forgiveness of sins and regeneration ... By baptism we are received into the Church , and assured , that we are now children of God , and joined and grafted into the body of Christ , and become his members   A pretty clear disjunction from the Reformed teaching of ‚Äò covenant children ‚Äô   This is basically Calvin . The reality is annexed to the sign in the Genevan Catechism for ex   Calvin was basically not a Calvinist . He gave birth to a tradition that substantially rejected his theology , on the Eucharist , on baptism . He wasn ‚Äô t a clear Dortian , or a Presbyterian . Didn ‚Äô t teach covenant theology . He ‚Äô s basically just ‚Äú a reformer ‚Äù without modern labels   "" Calvin was basically not a Calvinist "" is true and is , of course , the biggest take down of Calvinists .   Well , he would fit quite easily within the traditions of English Calvinism as it developed , for instance . But the harder stuff from Scotland and the Netherlands ... I mean , he didn't even like that in his own lifetime ...   Well , isn't that just the genius of the English and Irish churches in stopping later followers taking reformed doctrine too far ?   The part that's very strange is that the Welsh Calvinist tradition leans in that direction , despite the extreme oddness of its history .   Well , Calvinistic Methodism is just inherently so v odd ."

1,   Says a liberal hypocrite that did exactly that ! Hilarious ! #projection #VoidOfSelfAwareness #FredoCuomo,"Just to get this straight , according to Democrats , giving the Iranian terror regime access to hundreds of billions of dollars with no restrictions on terror use or ballistic missile testing was good , and killing the terrorist responsible for hundreds of American deaths is bad .  Ben did . In his mind . While constructing the strawman he continues using .   Yes Ben is excellent at fabricating straw man arguments .   Now what part of what he said isn ‚Äô t true ? I ‚Äô ll wait .   ‚Äú Democrats ‚Äù as a group did not say giving access to hundreds of billions of dollars is good . Facts are important . Ben is often light on providing any . He spouts partisan nonsense .   I ‚Äô m sorry but what is considered an appropriate people count then ? I ‚Äô ve read countless dismissive comments from Twitter grouping people together under the GOP label . Please stop parsing words ok Sport ?   Not going to stop parsing words , sport . Ben is allegedly a lawyer and should be well aware of the need to be accurate in his word use . He equates broad support for Iran deal with support for sending Iran its own money back with no strings . Since it was their money that we were   returning to them then it is likely we could put no strings on it anyway , and compliance such strings would have been impossible to verify . So Ben is making claims that have no basis n law or the actual facts . That is a problem , "" sport . ""   More than their ‚Äú own ‚Äù money was sent back to them Sport . And it was given to them in cash . They also got access to financial institutions , by the way the money has funded Hamas for 2 years now , another terrorist grouping you probably embrace   How stupid are you ? Do you actually read anything ? We settled a lawsuit in which they were claiming more money than we paid . The money was sent in cash to comply with legal restrictions Congress had put in place . We cannot stop Iran from using financial institutions . You clearly   need an education in how life works . Stop reading right wing propaganda and glean facts from multiple sources . That is what we are required to do these days if we want to get to the truth . That would you accuse someone who spent almost 30 years in the military of supporting Hamas   shows what a petty , insignificant idiot you actually are .   whoaaaaaa pump the brakes folks . This guy is a defender of the Constitution .   And you are a moron who thinks his petty insults mean something . They don't . They only show you to be the immature dimwit that you are .

0,"   Watched him testify too . to watch . What I pictured & what sat in #Congress was painful to watch . But one thing he did do , was come back to the Senate floor to make sure we all understood he found no crime . Found nothing . ","In the Clinton impeachment process , 66 witnesses were allowed to testify including 3 in the Senate trial , and 90,000 pages of documents were turned over . Trump was too afraid to let any of his top aides testify & covered up every single document . The Senate must #EndTheCoverUp  Nancy , if you weren ‚Äô t determined to rush through a sham impeachment , this wouldn ‚Äô t be an issue now would it ? ! ? You could have called all the witnesses you wanted in the House , but you didn ‚Äô t . YOU screwed up ! Don ‚Äô t whine now . üëç  In what way was it a Sham Bradley - give us details . We'll wait .   It wasn't a sham ! Some witnesses were blocked by Trump & going to court to contest could have taken months . The Democrats in the House handled the impeachment investigation admirably , despite so many of the questioning the witnesses behaved like clowns . #Coverup   Going to court when 2 branches of gov ‚Äô t have deference ‚Äô s in opinion , based on the LAW , is what #Presidents have done for decades . No news here . What is telling is the #fact Democrats have been calling for #impeachment from DAY ONE ! üëâ üëâ    So why didn't Trump go to court to block the witnesses from testifying - are you saying it is one rule for Trump and another rule for those trying to expose him ?   He did . Case pending.Stay tuned . Dem ‚Äô s too impatient to wait for court verdict , so they charged #President w / obstruction . ü§∑ üèª ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è üëâ  But hey , Sure is EXPOSING lots of corruption , right ? ! Time to bring these bad players into the arena : üëâ    He did not go to court to get witnesses blocked from testifying - that is just a lie by you . Which is standard for republicans now days . As for your links . FAUX NEWS ? ? ? HANNITY ? ? ? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   Maybe this article can help you understand , hard to explain with just a few characters :    As far as the links , #Democrats own words condemn them . #FactsMatter   Weak . If "" facts "" mattered , you wouldn't use a The Hill opinion piece & a Fox News clip about "" the whistleblower "" to support your stance . Btw , even if the whistleblower turns out to be less than impartial , TRUMP deserved impeachment for abuse of power & obstruction of Congress .   Their ( #Democrats ) own words ! üòÇ ü§£ üòÇ THINK ! All that matters , is the #fact THEY said it ! They wrote the emails . They talked about a #coup . They said DAY ONE . They own it ! Sorry if that offends you .   It doesn't matter if a Democratic politician , or 2 or 3 , or more , desperately wanted Trump impeached ( or even said "" coup "" ) , TRUMP provided cause . He obstructed the Mueller investigation , & even AFTER THAT committed the Ukraine abuse of power & obstruction . He's a knucklehead .   That ‚Äô s not what Mueller said . In fact , he found NOTHING to charge #President . If he could ‚Äô ve he would ‚Äô ve . But his #coup attempt failed w / all the MILLIONS he spent , couldn ‚Äô t find that needle ! üò´ I didnt like #Obama either , but unlike you I would never suppt a .

While Iran will never be able to properly admit it , Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country . They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe .

Pooling and sharing is very , very real and we'd find out the hard way if we dividing the UK as you want to .   Really ?

You don't think direct investment in Scotland on the scale there has been in SE England would be of greater benefit to the Scottish economy ?   As I've pointed out before the fiscal transfer is a myth . Even if it were true don't you think it would be a better idea to have an economic policy the whole country would benefit from ?   The whole country does benefit . That's what the map shows . Haven't you got a march to go to ?   So the whole country would benefit from investing in Scotland instead wouldn't it ?

1, PS : I ‚Äô m sure Israel and the US will be much more likely to cooperate with the Court now that the OTP has sought a jurisdictional ruling that will almost certainly go against Israel .,"1 ) W / benefit of time to digest , please find here my thread on #ICC #OTP jurisdictional request re #Palestine & Twitter response . Sorry ,   & less so  ... some serious pushback on its way ! 2 ) Time to get on my hobby horse and say that the online responses to this filing again demonstrates how the #ICL court practitioner viewpoint is so underrepresented not only on Twitter , but the #ICL #ICC advocacy / policy / diplomatic / commentary community writ large .3 ) For those who are #ICL litigators , the wisdom & ethnics of Fatou Bensouda's filing is manifest . While Patryk alluded to it , he gave it far too little weight . There may be a difference of opinion , but OTP's move was by far the wiser .4 ) It would be ethnically & professionally reprehensible for OTP to go forward w / investigation , talk to witnesses & victims ( raise their exposure / protection issues ) , utilize staff time from not only OTP but other offices ( $ ) , spend large sums of money on the investigation itself , ...5 ) ... have to manage expectations that will undoubtedly soar no matter what , and deal w / a myriad of challenging cooperation and related complications , all for the case to collapse years later on jurisdictional issues that could have been resolved years prior .6 ) It is not hard to imagine the incredible backlash that would come in such a scenario ; a misstep that the #Israel / #Palestine issue / lobbies would use to eat the #ICC alive . The Court must act prudently , ethically , & professionally to navigate this terrain successfully .7 ) To wait on this jurisdictional issue at a later juncture ( likely much later too ) has so many potential pitfalls , as described above , and would play right into the hands of realpolitik hardliners , or states wanting an "" out "" .8) Need for significant pushback on Kevin's & Patryk's threads where they insinuate ( if not outright say ) that the jurisdictional issue is best determined at a later stage when the proverbial train has already left the station . I question whether these were serious points .9 ) If we analyze this closely ( & open to me misinterpreting your comments ) , it is to say that an uber tricky legal & political issue should be decided by the fact that resources & time has already been spent , so no good reason to stop now . What ? ! ?10 ) This issue should be decided by the letter of the law , not the expenditure of time , resources , and the like . If the Ct rejects jurisdiction & it is upheld on appeal , then so be it . We cannot manipulate ( diff from strategy ) the system to get the result we want / think it should be . Notice here how Kip describes complying with the Rome Statute as ‚Äú manipulating the system . ‚Äù As Patryk and I both pointed out , the Rome Statute does * not * require the OTP to adjudicate jurisdiction at this point . Major mischaracterization . Not saying ‚Äú it ‚Äù is a manipulation , but the reasons given for litigating later appear to be manipulation of the situation . Not mischaractizing anything . You said that , ‚Äú diff [ erent ] from strategy , ‚Äù waiting until later to litigate jurisdiction would ‚Äú manipulate the system . ‚Äù Show me where the law says the OTP has to do it now . Again , you conveniently leave out the reasons given to litigate later ( ie the train has left the station and that pressure will decide the matter ) . That is manipulating the system . I see . So complying with the rules in a manner that maximises your chances of success is ‚Äú manipulating the system . ‚Äù And I ‚Äô m the one that doesn ‚Äô t understand the practitioner ‚Äô s perspective ! You have defined success here as only having one outcome . Maybe it could occur to you that the OTP is investigating the matter fairly and evenly , and don ‚Äô t want to do so if outside the Court ‚Äô s jurisdiction . Yes , I have defined success as a practitioner would ‚Äî achieving one's litigation goal , which here is to investigate the Palestine situation . Your definition is fine if you ‚Äô re working for an NGO , but lawyers want to win - - and ethical ones want to win within the rules . Again , define winning in terms of an INVESTIGATION , which this is . Yes , litigation of actual cases is where parties have clear goals of what is winning and losing . Not here . Further , you cannot be arguing that OTP defines winning as investigating in a situation where jurisdiction is lacking . So I am clear : I am not saying they don ‚Äô t have jurisdiction . OTP effort is to better safe than sorry , a wise move when dealing w / Israel #Palestine issue"

Sorry I can ‚Äô t be there today , but look forward to seeing you all again soon . In the meantime , sending my support and best wishes . I'm British .

I am seruously considering moving to Scotland in the next few years , so as to be able to stay near my admin and yet retain my EU citizenship rights . Do you think this will be a possibility ?  Independence doesn't mean Scotland staying in the EU . I'm afraid you've been misled .   Tells us why it would be beneficial for Scotland stay in the union ? I mean anything would be good ... üëÇ ! ! ? ? ? !   The pooling and sharing of resources that means that when different parts of the UK do well , they can fund those parts doing less well , and ensure public services are maintained . In the 80s and early 90s Scotland was a net contributor , in the years since we have had net benefit .   London Docklands was unproductive wasteland in 1980s . Investments from rest of country resulted in development and is now massive contributor to UK revenues including to Scotland .   Total bollocks both of you . Scotland , like many regions of England has been starved of investment and any joined up economic planning . The only for Scotland to prosper is to take control of our own resources . Pooling and sharing is a myth .   Economic planning is devolved . You should complain to the SNP . Independence means losing billions of pounds a year . Pooling and sharing is very , very real and we'd find out the hard way if we dividing the UK as you want to .   Really ? The Scottish gov decided to invest billions in HS2 , London Crossrail , the Olympics development , Trident renewal , tax breaks for oil companies etc . Scotland is a wealthy country with enormous potential .   Too many myths ( HS2 , Crossrail , Olympics etc ) to bother with there . And infrastructure investment in any part of the economy benefits whole economy through added productivity .   Myths ? More nonsense . You don't think direct investment in Scotland on the scale there has been in SE England would be of greater benefit to the Scottish economy ?   As I've pointed out before the fiscal transfer is a myth . Even if it were true don't you think it would be a better idea to have an economic policy the whole country would benefit from ?   The whole country does benefit . That's what the map shows . Haven't you got a march to go to ?   So the whole country would benefit from investing in Scotland instead wouldn't it ? As for marches we can get tens of thousands to march on a terrible day like this the union can't get anyone except your pals in the OO to March in the middle of summer .   We don't organise marches . We don't want to change Scotland's place in the UK ."

At least those films know the difference between a good guy and a bad guy , in fact it's kind of the whole point of those films .

Nope , there are good guys and bad guys , it's decided at birth , and then you just make sure your costume colors match   It's a hard argument to say good guys and bad guys are a thing in reality   I was being mildly sarcastic with my initial comment , but there are plenty examples of both good and bad people in real life . For example , did you know that Nazis are bad ? In fact I'm pretty sure we had a war about it .   I don't know , those kids in "" JoJo Rabbit "" seemed okay . Joseph Beuys and Klaus Kinski were Nazis and they're both delightful ( maybe not Kinski , so much ) . We don't always get to pick our nation-state and century in which we're born .

But a bunch of people don ‚Äô t believe him . Interesting .

In short Orange is guilty Jewel was not .   Admissions ? As in releasing the transcript of the perfect call ? Those kind of admissions ?   The call perfectly showed he should be impeached . Admitted everything he is charged with in his own words .   Impeached because he wants to make sure our tax dollars for aid aren't falling into corrupt hands ? Yeah . That is dire indeed . I guess Biden bribing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor going after Hunter is completely within your logic and approval .   He knew differently and so did everyone who testified .

No deflection , just an added factor to the overall case of DO NOTHING Democrats .   It is deflection unless you can say one action caused the other .

I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù . The terrorist orchestrated an attack on the US embassy . His expectation should have been that the US military would kill him . Simple .  If only life were so simple . It ‚Äô s not . The last time the United States killed a major military leader in a foreign country was during World War II , when the American military shot down the plane carrying the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto .  Iran already knew there are consequences . Now they have no choice but to respond . Now the Iraqi parliament wants us out . To not do so would be violating their sovereignty . Iraq is Iran ‚Äô s . It ‚Äô s over . Let ‚Äô s get out . Other option is war w no plan , dead Americans .  I think you and I agree there are no good options .  When we fought the Cold War we didn ‚Äô t assassinate Russian Generals who had caused the death of Americans and their allies in proxy wars .  Would we have if they orchestrated attacks on our embassies ?  It ‚Äô s called diplomacy . Taking out Soleimani is dangerous . Threatening to take out holy sites is playing into the hands of Jihadis everywhere . He doesn ‚Äô t understand his enemy . He doesn ‚Äô t understand himself . He ‚Äô s the biggest threat to peace in the world right now , hands down .  I've also heard the general is despised by the Iranian people .

1," Dude who named himself "" true talent "" accusing people of being narrcissistic . üòÇ","Good to see there are some intelligent influences  in the dead by daylight community who can actualy hold a conversation .

You and  are the only DbD content creators I like ; you both try to actually be mature and I ‚Äô ve learnt a lot of stuff from your videos - mad respect to the both of you . Too many immature , or just plain toxic creators out there unfortunately  narcissistic , toxic influences have exploded by being themselves in dbd so im not suprised tbh ."
1,   It was that a revolution  vernacularization  was employed to enable reactionary authority . ? Sure .," he stayed firmly within the theological and religious so yesdo you mean  - not reactionary in the sense of Thomas More , but reactionary as the precursor to the early Bourgeois revolutions ?  Protestant revolutions were in that they demand reconfigured state and position of individual  you mean more reactionary than the catholic church ? how ?  Reactionary is not the word for the position of Catholic Church at the time ‚Äî thought-empire  Perhaps the Holy Roman Empire and Charlemagne could be considered as such ...  Interesting that there are a lot of Catholic neoreactionaries today though !  yes I suppose the early 16th C is too early , though in England catholicism was reaction   Luther was ' reacting ' to a mutation that had itself long become conservative ( of its own power ) .   So Luther's reform was actually ‚Äî from his pov ‚Äî a purification , a return to what was before the then -   That's nonsense you misapprehend how radical a gesture vernacularisation was at the time   Yes , Luther as v late stage of linguistic evolution out of MA ( Petrarch , Dante , Chaucer , Tyndale , & c ) . But I think  ' s pt is that Luther's return to archaic purity of institutions was an authoritarian Rx . "

I am saying that is what the law is . Do not agree that even in life or death you can force another to do something . #Singlepayer is not about "" forcing "" , it's about "" paying for "" . It would remove a reason to deny treatment , the Dr volunteers 2B a Dr 97 % of doctors enter into medicine for the money . Ok so "" paying for "" . Who is responsible for paying for YOUR health ? Nice statistic ! Too bad it's 100 % false . We're in it together , our costs are linked , & we can get more 4 less if we pool resources and why is that ? That is the problem with your arguments . cuz when I don't pay , you pay more . When my ins comp denies coverage & I go on medicare , your taxes pay for it anyway . no that is NOT why . That is one part of why . Keep guessing . Your whole argument is superficial rhetoric your were told to believe . lol , you're not countering my arguments by simply calling them rhetoric . I'm using logic , you're trying to label it something else no you are not using logic . If you were you would not be FOR the ACA . You are just regurgitating rhetoric . Who's talking about the ACA ? I'm arguing for a #SinglePayer system . ACA not even close to where we should be . hahaha . Oh you're serious . Now I understand why you don't get a simple request to end the conversation .

Yay me .  I don't think he's reading it because he believes it , I think he's reading it so it can confirm how insanely bullshit it all is .  I was reading it again to bring back to memory what is contained therein since I forgot many things about it .  Oh I prefer to get my questions answered from the primary source or experts .  Well how one would reconcile the contents therein with science ( heliocentrism , evolution ) , what the basis for clear condemnation of unbelievers ( including Christians , Atheists , idol worshippers ) is , how one would reconcile the Qu ‚Äò ran with fictional figures like Moses among others  Quran is Pro science . Nothing in it contradicts science . Quran is word of God and science is works of God . They both cant possibly contradict    Lol , all holy texts I'm aware of contradict not only reach other , but basic science in fundamental ways . You can try to "" make it work "" by using very liberal interpretations , which is an ok start since it tends to somewhat moderate the worst abuses ...   Another self acclaimed expert in all religions ? Have you read Quran cover to cover ? Feel free to ask what you don't understand but to go on to make baseless allegations isn't what gentlemen do   Cover to cover ? No . Name a holy text that you haven't read cover to cover--could that faith be correct ? I also haven't read every pro creationist or astrology argument , but in each car , I've read - enough - :)   All major religions came from the same God . Quran testifies to the truth of them . They are on the same side . It's you who need to read and research to find truth and have a right to reject , Otherwise it's just your blind faith and prejudice based rejection   You didn't answer the question directly , but did so indirectly :) Of course there are holy texts you haven't read ( at all , or in part ) because they all reject the idea that they came from / are influenced by / are in and some way beholden or sub to the Quran ...   I don't need to read other holy scriptures . I'm not the one rejecting them üòÑ It's all from same God YOU are the one rejecting them . You need to learn about something to have a valid reason to reject   No , lol . The claim that it's "" all the same God "" in and of itself invalidates your point :) I've no doubt read more holy text than you , even if I haven't read the Quran cover to cover .   You have no clue what you are talking about . You are running away from the fact that you are uneducated about religions but still reject them based on prejudice"

When he advocates nationalizing industries and central planning for the economy , he ‚Äô ll be a socialist . Right now , he ‚Äô s a social democrat .  In fact , the current tariffs + targeted exemptions + farm subsidies are much closer to socialism than anything Bernie is proposing .  Yes , with the stuff I ‚Äô ve read about the past couple of days with the targeted exemptions , it ‚Äô s worse . That ‚Äô s a type of legalized corruption and political favoritism ."

And its not out of context ..

No , no you dont and you've proven that over and over   Lol , we're just not dumb enough to confuse assault weapons with ALL guns . Come on , you're really not this dumb are you ?   Difference between assault weapons and the rest of the firearms .. go ...   automatic assualt weapon = 1 trigger pull fires many rounds , semi automatic , = you have to squeeze the trigger for each round you fire   Except that's not VAs definition : Assault weapons "" are defined as a semi-automatic , centerfire , firearm equipped with a folding stock , or equipped at the time with a magazine capable of holding more than 20 rounds , or capable of accommodating a silencer / suppressor .   And again you deflect to something that's not even in the bill . What is wrong with you ? After being so thoroughly proven wrong , most would learn , but you keep going !   Wow . I posted the actual full bill , and the definition of assault firearms according to VA law , and you're STILL trying to lie about it . Wow .   So let me get this straight . I give you the definition from the official government site , and you post a screenshot from who knows where ? Lol , you crack me up !"

Things are in your favour .So for you #BuyNothingDay on Black Friday was a way of undoing the psychology of "" I must have more , more , more . "" But what about others ?What about the poor kid that was able to afford a laptop on Black Friday ? So they could study etc ?What about the poorer folks for whom Black Friday was a God send , to be frank , because they could buy things they otherwise couldn't afford ?You wanna resist capitalism and consumerism ? Good . Me too . But let's not universally shame those who shop on Black Friday ...( Not saying everyone who did #BuyNothingDay was shaming obvs , but some of it did have that tone ) .Capitalism and consumerism is every . Damn . Day . Abstaining from Black Friday just means missing out on discounts tbh .Abstaining on Black Friday is really a symbolic act . And a good one . If you can do it . Just don't judge those who can't .AND to be honest , what would be better than #BuyNothingDay would be this : #GiveSomethingDayIf you've got the dollar to buy a laptop full price - why not give some money to charity ? Do more than abstain . Undo greed with generosity .Middle-class christians LOVE to be like "" lemme be revolutionary and not spend money on things I don't need anyway . "" And I'm one of them ."
1,  the funny thing about pro choice is that the baby was never given a choice,"  Face it you have no legitimate reason to dislike Trump nor do you address his policies foreign or domestic .

I get some people aren't pro life , they like the idea of legal murder to their own kids . as far as LGBT he's pro  So we know you are an anti abortion fanatic .  I'm pro life so if you don't like me for that that's your problem  You called me a murderer . I think the dislike started there ."

Indeed he is . But don't then blame others for the manifesto . Especially if you lose votes and seats in Brexit areas .   I don ‚Äô t think Tom is blaming anyone .

And you can stop the smears now , the GE is over . ü§¶   The truth is not smears . If you think Corbyn and his cronies are in trouble now just wait until January when the EHRC publishes the result of its investigation into institutional racism in the Labour Party .   I'll read it as soon as they've completed one anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the Tory Party . They then should be a proper investigation on the Tory government and Windrush . But I won't hold my breath .   If the EHRC receives the volume of complaints about the Conservative ‚Äô s as they have against Labour then they will open an investigation . That ‚Äô s how the process and law works . At the moment , it ‚Äô s only the Labour Party that is under formal investigation for institutional racism .   Antisemitism and Islamophobia are 2 things which affect the UK population , less than 1 % and 6 % respectively .

1,   For someone who preaches religion - you seem to be an extremely assuming angry judgmental person . Good night .,"Transgender children may start to identify with toys and clothes typical of their gender identity from a very young age , a recent study suggests .  Preschool . Some parents however choose to ignore the signs of their child simply wanting to be who they are authentically . All hatred stems from ignorance & fear . Love your kids for who they are , not how you feel they should be . We ‚Äô re entitled to share their life , not own it .  Selling your child out to this madness is really sad The mental illness in America is alarming   Selling out ? ? What monetary profit would be had by ‚Äú forcing ‚Äù a child to be transgender ?   You are as confused of that ignorant parent .. Selling your child out at an early age because of their confusion ... Mental illness is Alive and Well in America   Selling them out still disgusting lifestyle that usually leads to Suicide once they realize what has been done to them Maybe it's time to turn to the Lord instead of perversion   Oh yes because the church has never abused children and made them commit suicide   Please tell me what that has to do with forcing a child to change genders and leading them to a life of misery Only a liberal would come up with such an analogy   Who forces any child to change gender . That ‚Äô s abuse . Has nothing to do with being trans or gay .   It ‚Äô s similar to those ‚Äú vegan ‚Äù parent that feed their infants oat milk instead of formula . It has nothing to do with the diet and everything to do with being an abusive parent .   How can you even draw comparison between that and forcing your child to become the opposite sex even though it's impossible and will lead to their destruction   Who ‚Äô s forcing a child to be trans . It appears it ‚Äô s only you not following the facts and speaking with little to no knowledge . But ‚Äú peace be with you ‚Äù ...   Okay genius enlighten me tell me how a girl becomes a boy or a boy becomes a girl Science can do it but I'm sure you can The liberal loonies are lost   They decide they want to be and can choose to go one hormones like T and also surgeries to add or remove breasts , etc .   You can do whatever you want but it does nothing to change your genetics you are with the Lord made you accept you decide to make yourself perverse through those actions   An egg or two and a determined little sperm ( DNA ) create babies .   Humans are born with 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs . The X and Y chromosomes determine a person's sex . Most women are 46XX and most men are 46XY .   I ‚Äô m glad you learned how to use google .   I learned that in Biology class while you were smoking weed"

1,"  see what you did ? I ‚Äô m out here defunding LJ because of the ruckus you created . Now I got grown men being emotional because I touched on sore subjects for them ... now I ‚Äô m muted , he will never know my opinion .. thanks a lot Drew !","I keep seeing the argument that Lamar Jackson could be a running back if he wanted to . I'm not sure how people justify that but it's incorrect . The amount of extra protection LJ is given and the runs he does that's not what a RB has to work with . Also Mark Ingram needs more love You don ‚Äô t think he could be a RB in the NFL ? He could maybe be a Theo Riddick . No I don't see why he would be . I think the same thing about Taysom hill . Everytime someone goes to tackle him they have to do it in the context that he is a QB and could slide at any moment . That's just one reason It's also more difficult to be a tall RB . 215 at 6 ' 2 "" is a looot different than 215 at 5 ' 8 "" Man you love generalizing , rather then just looking at that player There is a difference between generalizing and comparing historical data . You just keep assuming I hate him , which is ironic . Read my words not what you want them to say .  So this is true for every player at that size ? Every single one ? Your right Lamar Jackson transcends football and is unstoppable . Let's throw away every historical trend for comparison because LJ is just that good . Got it I mean name one player in . NFL history he compares too , skill wise + body size ? I already did . Taysum hill almost identical height and weight and is a QB I said SKILL WISE . The disrespect even putting those 2 names together . He runs 4.4 ? Throw  for 33 tds in 13 games ? ? ? Almost identical height and weight , that ‚Äô s the only thing comparable . See why your ‚Äú historical ‚Äù data is wrong ? Because no one like Lamar has been in the NFL . He does run a 4.4 actually and Sean Peyton has nothing but praise . He doesn't throw TDs because Brees is there . I get you like Lamar but it's ok to think he is mortal . Taysum hill is actually used a lot like Jackson and has similar skills . The Godhood you are creating is weird You have been searching for angles and slights . Claiming ‚Äú historical data ‚Äù proves he isn ‚Äô t that good . When in fact no one in the history of the league has his skill set ( 32 GMS / coaches ) will tell you that . You hurt cause you were wrong , take your L and 3rd string QB outta here I have to mute you . Sorry I know you followed me but you have been nothing but toxic to me . I legit try to have conversations and you are making this personal . Calling me racist then saying I'm trying to make Lamar look bad . I'm done . Have a nice day"
0," Wow ! ! ! Thank you for making that program ! ! Brilliant , well done ! #ApocalypseCow","‚Äú When you take into account the forests and other ecosystems that would otherwise grow on land used by livestock , scientists estimate the carbon cost of just 4 kg of beef is equivalent to taking a flight from London to New York and back again . ‚Äù  1/2Searchinger et al estimate the global av carbon opportunity cost of beef is 1250kg per kg of protein . The protein content of beef ~ 25 % . Figures from Atmosfair suggest a return flight from London to New York generates about 986kg of CO2 per passenger .  2/2‚Äú Government figures show that livestock farms in the UK receive on average ¬£ 26,000 a year in subsidies . ‚Äù ‚Äú Remember those 23m sheep that occupy so much of the UK ? Well , they provide just over 1 % of our food , in terms of calories . ‚Äù Total av consumption of lamb + mutton in UK is 5.0 kg per person per year :  1/2100g of lamb contains approximately 294kcal .  So annual av calorie intake from lamb is ~ 14,700 kcal . Annual av total calorie intake per person in the UK is ~ 1,250 , 000 kcal :  . Therefore lamb provides roughly 1.18 % of our calories . 2/2‚Äú But , the surprising truth is that it [ free range meat ] causes more damage to the living world than indoor livestock farming , because it uses much more land , mostly for pasture :  ‚Äú One third of the world ‚Äô s crops are being grown to feed to livestock . ‚Äù ‚Äú ninety percent of all the soya humans consume is embedded in fish , eggs , meat and dairy . ‚Äù ‚Äú you look at the net carbon impacts of livestock , they ‚Äô re horrendous . ‚Äù ‚Äú Rivers which are now polluted more by farming than by any other industry . ‚Äù ‚Äú only fourteen percent of rivers in England and Wales are in good ecological health ‚Äì an even worse figure than a few years ago . ‚Äú  ‚Äú In America , factory farms are producing thirteen times more sewage than all the humans put together . ‚Äù ‚Äú It is being damaged so quickly that , according to the UN , we have just sixty years of harvests left . ‚Äù ‚Äú At this rate , farming won ‚Äô t be able to feed the growing human population . ‚Äù ‚Äú The number of farm animals is increasing twice as fast as the number of humans . ‚Äù ‚Äú In Britain alone , we eat so much meat that we use twice as much farmland as the country possesses . ‚Äù The UK ‚Äô s agricultural land footprint is 408,090 km2 . The area of land in the UK used for agriculture is 171,900 km2 .  ‚Äú Food ‚Äô s global footprint would be miniaturised . ‚Äù Currently the most land-efficient means of growing protein is South American soya , which produces 2.5 tonnes per hectare per year . Solar Foods ‚Äô manufacturing projection is 50,000 tonnes per hectare per year .‚Äú the team claims they could supply enough protein to feed all the world ‚Äô s people in an area the size of Ohio . ‚Äù Daily protein requirement : 50g . x 7.5 billion = 140mt pa . 50,000 t per ha pa means 2800 hectares .

1,  I'm sure your choice to post a gif from the movie that defines your life had nothing to do with your INABILITY to explain how a single failure in a system is justification for discarding the whole system .," While I'm glad a good guy with a gun stopped him from slaughtering that congregation , two men whose lives mattered were slaughtered because the bad guy had a gun to begin with . Guns are a problem .  Two points : 1 ) You can't eliminate guns . 2 ) The killer can kill without a gun ( Arson , vehicular homicide , and many more ways to do so ) , but it's a lot harder to stop them without one .   Right . And men with guns stopped him . If you take away all the guns from the scenario , he could use another weapon to kill people , but the people would have no effective means to fight back .   So a knife has a faster kill rate than an AR or shotgun ? I'd rather take my chances against the knife . This old trope of an argument is spoon fed NRA garbage .   No , but a vehicle does . And what's the best way to stop a madman with a vehicle ? That's right , a gun . What you're saying is that you'd rather be disarmed completely , and hope killers use ineffective ways to kill people , than have the opportunity to defend yourself effectively .   I'm saying that the argument of gun control leaves guns with criminals , or they will kill somehow anyway so may as well be a gun , are tired overused propaganda from the NRA . No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must .   But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . "" Assault weapon "" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ?   And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ?   Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools .   We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that .   It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say "" Eh , I'm sure you're fine "" and selling the gun .   Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law .   It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway .   It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc .    It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited . The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market .  Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it . Don't even buy another one , because if one car fails then all cars are worthless , or at least I WOULD HAVE said that if I were INSANE ."

Reduce workload and data drops to 2/3 per year = üëç check But also have data management system so that Governors know we are monitoring progress = ü§ù ? ? ? Excell spread sheet ? Something else ? What works in your schools ?  Have you asked your governors what they need to evidence progress ? Have governors seen the strategies being utilised ( are they visible ) ?  Agree with this . Personally I don't want to see data which isn't already existing . Because that demonstrates how you monitor progress .  Agree , wholeheartedly with this , time is precious and should be used wisely .  If you weren't already collecting the data because it wasn't helpful to you , then it is definitely of no use to me . Don't feel you have to go and do something different . Far better that an explanation of the data you do have is given to us .  I've been a governor myself since 1995 . Mostly I'm keen to know what systems are available that achieve both purposes .   If it works for the teaching staff it will work for governors . I imagine Excel spreadsheets are easiest for everyone on both sides ? Maybe setting up via Google Docs .

I love my but would never ask anyone to change if they love their current system . Having data tasks has got to be enhancing as opposed to a chore - all the recommendations will be spot on and the proof is in the pudding   Systems need to be easy to use , customisable , capable of storing all data a school needs in one place . Schools should not have to make compromises to fit rules of a system . Teachers should be able to easily access any data on children .   And data for governors needs to be simplified . Too much data is dumped on governors without much strategy . Many systems provide governors access ( good thing ) but thought needs to go into what reports they use .   Think an explanation of the data is as important as the data itself ."

0,   you looking for some attention . Instead of being a d #ck buy a Puppy dog Q,"Good morning to everyone especially  who received a huge roaring standing ovation at the national championship football game , yesterday . Fake News can ‚Äô t hide how much President Trump is loved all around our country .

0,   I understand . So if no one follows caste system anymore why are there so many conversions ? There maybe dongi pastors But None are violent unlike #jihad How can you convince people who still feel enslaved in villages that they are all equal ? That's #Jesus message,"I need people who can tag my tweets to Media .. Local newspapers and TV channels ... Just 1 tweet every 2 or 3 days ... Can you do that ? ... dont respond to this tweet by saying YES ... start tagging   Don't preach non sense here . Stop deceiving people and selling false miracle to get poor converted to Christianity . That is what this channel is trying to achieve . We are not killing anyone . Religion is personal and best kept privte . You with your convrson are wiping out cultures   So you are saying you will bring violence to anyone that says something that you do not agree with ? An eye for an eye and the whole world is blind Even Gandhi from India preached non violence We repeat the same mistakes and wonder why se dont make progress Open your mind bud .   Stop preaching nonsense and come to the point . Shove Gandhi in your a $ $ . You have no right to defame Hindu Gods and start praising yours to gain followers by deceiving people . Don't expect us to keep looking when you don't understand the mistake your are doing .   This time it is no more eye for an eye .. you defame us we will come back with 10x more violence . Don't play your victim card here . Grow up ignorant idiot   Please note , here is a mentally deranged individual that needs to curtail his violence . She is out to do no good . Reporting this tweet for action   Oh Twitter .. please on the name of Jesus .. I request you to suspend my account . üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÄ üòÄ . Enough amusement . get out of this discussions now   Add 1 acre land and 2 tolas gold . You forgot ? Watch what happens when you accuse leftists of the same crime ... Mythology is just that . Countless fairy tales repeated over and over by dongi baba's and botched rewrites and violence through religion Let the drum roll begin ...   1 acre land and 2 tolas gold ? Did they give your ancestors that as well to abandon their actual religion and embrace Christianity ? What mythology are you taking about ? Remember we are not blaming you but peple who deceive poor and convert . Don't discuss dhongi babas to defend them   Everyone who converts gets 50 tolas gold . You don't know ? That's why #Christians are most persecuted in the world esp by #RadicalIslam but soon #radicals in will start too Why Mythology never taught in schools ? Because syllabus only has History ! Real events   Not intersted to know how much givn to traitors to get converted . Well if Christians are most persecuted ... the reason must be because you fools are trying to conquer the world with your religion and wiping out cultures . Hindu mythology never taught because that was is wrong hands   In that case you are FAR FAR departed from your Santana Dharm because nowhere does Hindu mythology maintain violence , like you do !   Don't teach me Sanatan Dharma . My dhrama also says if anyone is doing wrong , I have all right to stop that that from happening , let that be done with violence . Religion is persnal and best kept privte . You are not here to conquer the world with your religion . Don't deceive people   This is why #Missionary is winning ... They teach #violent people like you more #peace about your own that even tou know about Had you cared to spread the , you would have put out of   You see the stupid totka with name of Jesus doesn't work . You still back with your stupidity and trying to defend your actions . Truth is ur God is a insecure dumb who had ordered u people to go and convert , so that u can conquer the world with ur religion .   See your own logic : Call me stup 1d , Call others stup 1d , Label the whole religion stup 1d , smear all of society . Will never work If your Truth is my God is a insecure dumb who had ordered people to go and convert , Why is your God and Santana dharma separating people with caste ?   Go learn why this system was bought and how it took a bad turn . This was bought to differentiate the work people do and later took an ugly turn . No one supports caste system anymore . That's a very old believe now . We all Hindus leave in harmony .. some peple in villags still follow"

0,  All of these players were linked to us under Sarri and Barella is at football,"I ‚Äô m massively optimistic because Lampard has shown he ‚Äô s a top market operator .

How can you say he has insane pull power when we haven't signed anyone yet lmao . Because he ‚Äô s Frank James Lampard . He ‚Äô s not some banker from Italy , nor is he a catenaccio bloke . He ‚Äô s flexible , works for a top club , and is a footballing legend . Look at the links chap . Devils in the details . So being linked with a player means he has pull power ? Give journalists and the scouts a raise then . We've made it because we are being linked with Sancho and Werner üëç Aren ‚Äô t you just the most simple minded chap . Who were Conte ‚Äô s targets ?

0,"   The "" value "" of Money refers to the metal content of a coin . üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ","   The official Monet Unit or standard adopted by England in 1903 , then the American Colonies , then Constitution was the Spanish Milled Dollar ‚Äî or "" Pieces of Eight "" , a fixed weight of silver .   ‚Ä¢ The only "" Money "" Congress can bring into existence is silver & gold in the form of "" Coin "" . ART I , SEC 8 CL 5 . ‚Ä¢ States must use silver & gold only in all State governmental fiscal transactions . ART I , SEC 10 , CL1 .   The government also defined the dollar as 1/20 th of an oz of gold . But none of that matters . You're claim is that banks didn't use gold as specie to issue fiduciary media and that's batshit insane   Wrong . The companion coinage first minted in the U . S . in gold were designated as "" eagles "" not "" dollars "" , because a "" dollar "" is a fixed weight of silver . This is elementary .   No one is disputing that . Why you think that means there wasn't a gold standard is beyond me . You clearly have no idea how the banking system worked in the 29th century   Because the Money Unit or standard by in fact & law is silver .   You obviously don't know what the term gold standard means   Do you have a link to your money bill based on your "" gold standard "" ?   Can you for the record just explicitly state that banks didn't use gold specie just so everyone knows you're a crazy person ?   Let's see your money bill . Let's see your "" sanity "" . Surely you can't just be a Twitter scholar with nothing to back up your "" expertise "" .   I already linked you to two books on monetary history   Other people's books are not a bill . Talk is cheap . Let's see how your system is implemented . Do you have a link to your money bill based on your "" gold standard "" ?   I honestly can ‚Äô t follow what you ‚Äô re trying to do here , but is this what you ‚Äô re looking for , the act where gold is made the only standard for the dollar ?    When the Constitution used the term "" dollar "" in 1788 , it had a legal meaning then & there . Until you learn this , you will not understand .   We understand what you ‚Äô re saying . Just trying to figure out what your point is . You ‚Äô re demanding we go back to the same currency system ?   The Constitution requires government officials to perform all governmental fiscal transactions in silver & gold only .   Have the updated legislation throughout the centuries since been successfully challenged ? Why are you wasting so much energy screaming this into the wind ?   FYI ‚Äî if so much energy was "" being wasted "" no one would be discussing this ‚Äî which various States are . Must be difficult thinking you know everything . When you don't . üòâ    These geniuses , are they telling us what value they will assign to gold In their state ? The original $ 19.39 ? If the founders said so , it ‚Äô s basically gospel , yes ? Hell , I ‚Äô ll grab cash and go get me some gold for it !"

1, superdelegates .

Bernie is too left for US , IMO . & too polite to stand against Trump ( 1 ) I think he wd hv stood a better chance than Hillary , but who knows . What annoys me abt Hillary is that even she said : ( 2 ) "" I'm not a gd politician . "" They KNEW she wasn't a vote-getter . Fielded her bcoz they thought it was a shoe-in . Arrogant . Yeah , Trump really owes DNC & Hillary gratitude for his victory . He probably couldn't have done it without them .

Today reminds us of their bravery and the sacrifices they , and their families , make for our communities .  There already is gun control in NJ . In fact we have one of the strictest gun control laws in the nation .  Federally . Too much access to guns . Our country is saturated and people can travel with them .  Nothing much can really be done . The right to firearms is still a constitutional right and "" shall not be infringed "" .

1, you mean like you're catching the hint in this particular exchange ?,"  but why not forced ? You want to force women to have babies they don't want by banning abortion . Why not donation ?  is your position not ' life is precious , the state should prioritise it over individual inconveniences ' ?  that's a silly question to ask . Everyone believes that . Please don't deflect .  why do you believe we should disregard women's preferences to save a baby but not deceased wishes to save a baby ?  : Actions have consequences . Don't be having sex unless you are grown up enough to face reality .  explain why we should ignore preference of women to save a baby but not preference of deceased to save a baby ?  I'm not litigating abortion in general , I'm asking you about a specific contradiction . Can you answer it or not ?  : Why trade one life for another ? All life is important .  so you'd agree to both ban abortions AND make organ donations mandatory then ? what a predictable response of a Trump supporter being asked to employ a modicum of critical thinking Critical thinking ? Sounded more like a broken record repeating the same old tired question over and over ! Haha ! to be fair that's because she deflected the first 11 times I asked her basically the same question Because your 2 dimensional thinking prevented you from grasping the concept that she didn't want to answer ur question ! I'm sure she's more than capable of communicating this if that's how she felt . Don't patronise her autonomy . Has nothing to do with her and everything to do with you pestering people for no good reason ! if a person posts controversial remarks about what women should do on a public forum they should expect to be asked about it I don't think it's ' pestering ' to ask them to clarify an apparent contradiction in their public view on a public forum 11 times ? Most people would catch the hint after the 1st two ! Oh I'm sorry , you're a Killary follower !"

I'm sure if u saw it as choice between no car crash or a good car crash , u wud feel need to speak out , vote or not  In the eyes of millions of #Remain'ers - leaving #EU is itself an insane + disasterous decision .

Now there ‚Äô s a story where Trump is owed a few more terms because of the harassment he ‚Äô s apparently been receiving . And the right wing nuts are buying the incorrect information . ü§°    Two-term limit was an amendment it can be repealed and don't get it twisted   Of course ! But who in their right mind would repeal that ! Protecting your family is your number one responsibility   ‚Äú Civil rights before Gun Rights ‚Äù is a common sense principle .   And whose civil rights are being infringed upon in this America in this America even the idiots and the morons get a voice

1,"   Any organisation equally lambasted by the Left for being Tory , and by the right for being Liberal-Marxist is OK by me . I quoted the Guardian because it was the publisher of the article . In all its establishment finery ...","As this grim and dismaying year winds down , the story is , for me , the successful destruction of the Labour party by the BBC . 1We have the most right wing press in Europe :  also the least trusted :  2The role of the BBC is , thus , critical . Operating in a sea of commercial press and broadcasters which are almost exclusively right or centre , BBC ‚Äô s self-proclaimed ‚Äò impartiality ‚Äô is the bulwark . 3The bulwark failed . BBC become just another right-wing voice , pumping out the same hate and bigotry as every other right-wing news outlet . 4BBC failed the UK . It allowed Corbyn and the left to be turned into an Aunt Sally , a punchbag for every angry stupid right-wing BBC jerk to have a go at . It became a monstrous bully . 5BBC ‚Äô s role in the future looks uncertain . Johnson seems inclined to make threatening noises , presumably so BBC can claim the ‚Äò both sides criticise us so we must be doing something right ‚Äô argument beloved of ignorant Tories . 6Like someone watching a car crash and saying , ‚Äò Yes I ‚Äô ve got a bit of a sore knee as well , I need an ambulance too . ‚Äô 7BBC News breached its Charter in every broadcast of the last 4 years . BBC news broke election purdah rules just about every day of the campaign . BBC became a lawless free-for-all , in which Corbyn-hating voices , no matter how compromised or cynical , were given uncritical space . 8BBC topical comedy became infected also : Labour antisemitism ‚Äò jokes ‚Äô right across BBC ‚Äô s comedy output . Doubly corrosive , because delivered by faces we love and trust ( or used to ) because they make us laugh . 9BBC has lost the left , probably for good . Anecdotally , leftsists are cancelling their DDs and switching it off , permanently . It ‚Äô s hated in a way I ‚Äô ve never seen before . 10Whether this matters to it or not is unclear : recent pronouncements about ‚Äò conspiracy theories ‚Äô from DG Baron Hall and Huw Edwards are not encouraging : they have learned nothing , seemingly , and are in denial about what ‚Äô s happened . 11BBC stumbles on , corrupt , stupid , bigoted and blind . The country needs it to be impartial for democracy to have any chance , and BBC abandoned its impartiality a long time ago . 12Until BBC is fixed , UK will continue to be broken , and the Labour party will continue to be crucified by it . Labour could have taken action : instead they aligned themselves with the bullies . If you don ‚Äô t fight you get beaten , which is of course what happened on Dec 12 . 13We are in crisis . Labour is in crisis . The country is in crisis . BBC is in crisis . And the crisis will continue whilst BBC exists in its present form . We deserve and need better than this , and we ‚Äô re not going to get it . We are a failed state , with a failed state broadcaster . 14   I do . It is a site where ideologies are contested on a massive scale but its content and management are not state-directed . See ' s excellent investigation into , some of it serialised    Who appoints the the top jobs at the BBC ? Who controls the purse strings ? Why are you quoting the Guardian ? Wake up ."

0, Many Christians who voted for Trump did so because they did not like HRC's position on Hyde,"In Fracture , I wrote about the Democrats ' post-LBJ reflex to marginalize liberals and people of color to chase conservative white voters ...That reflex resulted in the nomination of a southern , Christian conservative , Jimmy Carter , and the sidelinig of the Kennedy wing in 1976 .... and it culminated in the rise of the DLC and Bill Clinton in the 1990s , complete with "" welfare reform , "" DOMA , DADT and the crime bill .It was all about reversing the flight of white working class voters , angered by busing , civil rights protests , riots and affirmative action .Once McGovern got wiped out , Democrats set out on a 50 year project to make the party more palatable to the Pabst Blue Ribbon voter .In 2008 , the Democratic coalition , grown by liberal white voters , union members and swelling masses of voters of color , won back the WH .If LBJ and his civil rights push represented a second Reconstruction , you could say Obama's election represented a third ... complete with a dramatic repudiation of much of Clintonism , especially on gay rights . The party / culture got more diverse and more liberal .America's history is that each Reconstruction era incites a fierce backlash . The first was violent , the second attacked the FDR & LBJ eras .The third produced Trumpism : which is only partly about economics ( note that the poorest white voters chose Clinton , not Trump ) .Trumpism is about what every Reconstruction backlash is about : restoring cultural norms that the majority finds comforting and empowering .So what are Democrats preparing to do in response ? The same thing they did before : pander to conservative white voters and spurn their base .Why ? Because the same media elite who made emails bigger than boasting about assaulting women are "" advising "" them to It would be a strange response to winning the popular vote by hundreds of thousands of votes , but if past is prologue , it's what's coming .We'll have this discussion on the show later .

HOW was pts pain managed / decreased at discharge ? How many ( if any ) pts dropped out ? Due to increased / uncontrolled pain ?   Great questions Marilyn I trained at Stanford and rotated through their inpatient pain program . That ‚Äô s how I learned to wean without withdrawal . All the patients reached the end of their rope and were no longer controlled by opioids . Stanford knows what they ‚Äô re doing - 1/2   Every patient did well - more than well - EXCELLENT To determine their opioid need , I sat with a 20 ml syringe of fentanyl you see how much it took to ‚Äú touch ‚Äù their pain .

1,"energy via FUSION , I mean , "" string "" and plasma release ? Or , like everything else in our ATOM existence , is their a vibrational component that does not proportional relate to mass ... in some environments ? Or in simpler terms , Quanta Mechanics is based on vibration ...","So how do you power a spaceship through the void between stars ? Well , we KNOW matter is energy , but how do we get it to degrade ONLY into plasma , i . e . heat ? Also , if we found a way to stimulate energy to release copious amounts of plasma , then won't it pop in the last decay ?Thus destroying whatever technology around it , which is stimulating the energy to release copious amounts of plasma ? Also , how do you stimulate energy to release plasma without having to put excess energy into the system ? I mean , the vibrational variance between oxidation ...states of atoms is enough to cause them to release plasma , i . e . current rock technology . Therefore , the real question is : Can a dissonant vibrational pattern around the energy cause it to LOSE the "" strings "" that holds all the plasma together ? ( That was sarcasm ? ) Or ...does the dissonant vibrational pattern of the stimuli cause the moving bits of energy to rub the wrong way , in their complexity , to release plasma ? I KNOW energy is ONLY equal to mc2 , based upon our archaic methods of smashing with rock , but what if a dissonant energy pattern ...results in a billion kilo joules of plasma over the lifetime of one proton ? Much in the say way the vibration of the Distal Matter in the sun , causes all those protons to decay faster ? I mean , whatever is vibrating in the Sun is causing the protons to lose strings ... and plasma ?So let me reiterate the OUTSTANDING point : The vibration of the plasma , in the Sun , is causing the matter to decay at an exponential rates , which we perceive as energy ... and then relate back to MASS ... as it relates to the energy ... to explain how the sun releases so MUCH ..."

1,  Or slowdown the economy so much that people willingly move to Bangladesh . Which seems to be the preferred way of this government .,"This makes it only about Muslims but the NRC process had more non-Muslim victims . CAA seeks to mitigate effect on non-Muslims but even a small percentage on the large base will mean a lot of victims . All Indians should be worried for themselves as much as for their neighbors . This is like people said - only the corrupt should be worried about demonetisation . The people who paid the price were the common , poor folks . NRC will see the same . CAA is no go free card . But they were happy paying that price . At the time at least . Yes . A mistake . If people would have protested then , we would not have seen this day . Govt ‚Äô s confidence that they can make people go through the absurd only increased . They upped the ante now .  Now that they know SC is also taking it easy ( has done so with many many cases of recently ) , the protests , however large , are unlikely to change the stand of the govt .  We must continue and if need be collectively do non cooperation with the NRC process .  Non cooperation without an alternative ? We are not affected by immigrants but whose who are ( Assamese ? ) have a right to fight against it .  Well , this is the worst of laws . Doesn ‚Äô t help them and doesn ‚Äô t help rest of India too .  They don ‚Äô t want any outsiders . Religious identity doesn ‚Äô t matter . Even nationality doesn ‚Äô t . Large migration from within India will also have same opposition . They probably need some 370 like thing with state subject concept .  Nobody wants outsiders . Shivsena milking that for years here . But rate of influx is the concern . Rate of growth of Muslim pop is dropping everywhere but increasing in Assam . That suggests massive illegal immigration no ?   Yes , it does . But deporting people who have already come in with our state capacity is a nightmare . We have to even prove to Bangladesh that they are really from there . If we have to spend money , block the inflow ."
0,   You'll always be a tribute act to Scottish football fans .,"   Are you really saying that Craig Whyte didn't own Rangers Football Club ? All the papers and tv channels describe him as "" Rangers owner "" or "" former Rangers owner "" , why that ? If he didn't own Rangers , what did he own ?   He had a controlling stake in the plc , the end   Controlling stake in the PLC ? Who were the PLC ?   An entity never mentioned in all the years of Rangers Football club from 1872 - 2012 . Strange that . Then it appears magically after liquidation .   Ah the backup has arrived , the holding company scenario appeared well before the any liquidation was started , know the facts pal .   The one thing that legally proves the football club didn't survive was the players walking free from the dead football club .   Lmao how wrong you are , they walked due to tupe rules on transfer of contracts between companies after a buy out , know the facts pal .   Tupe is there to protect the players contracts and wages . Every player could have transferred their contracts to Sevco and Sevco would have been legally obliged to offer the players exactly the same contracts that they had at Rangers . Most players chose to walk away instead .   And it was their choice to do so or not , they had to agree to the transfer between companies , clever bhoy .   Correct , the club that they were contracted to died , they chose to walk away .   Yawnfest , if Rangers had died there wouldn't have been any need for tupe to advise the players dumb dumb .   Pal see if you honestly believe that Rangers weren't liquidated and are the same club crack on . Don't expect us to Swallow the BS . We never will .   Oh will when we win our 55th official title ( the next one we win ) & it's announced worldwide , then you'll wake up & realise you've been believing bs all these years ."

1,"   They are socialists . Their cruel intention is to propose this class war that unifying all classes to ... you know it , the working class . In other words , they want to end all other classes so they become one . It sure worked well in china huh","I strongly encourage all #Bernie2020 supporters to ignore trash like this . As someone who has a foot in both camps ( Bernie 2020 & the YangGang ) I can tell you this is nothing but a nasty smear against a natural ally and POTENTIAL VOTERS .   Yang is not a natural ally , he's pro capitalism and wants to reinforce it with placative measures to keep the poor from realizing class consciousness . He actively opposes leftist ideology .   If you truly do not support Yang that ‚Äô s OK . But time is better spent getting politically disengaged citizens to vote rather than trying to smear or attack other candidates and their supporters . There are millions of people who don ‚Äô t vote but can . Let ‚Äô s focus our efforts on that .   I'm focusing my efforts on getting people to vote for bernie sanders because he is the only leftist candidate , spreading class consciousness , ensuring that all people are provided for , and building a coalition of the working class .   That's really awesome , keep at it ! I hope you understand from my point of view how your tweet came off . I don't think we should point fingers at each other . Remember when Hillary basically blamed Bernie for losing ( heck she still does ) ? It's just not the attitude we should have   the issue is that yang supporters do not understand the concept of leftism and the struggle against the ruling class . i'm attacking yang because he fundamentally opposes leftism and supports right libertarian ideals   Regardless of how you might label his policies , most Americans would benefit the mist from them . That ‚Äô s the problem I tend to see amongst Bernie supporters , you can ‚Äô t seem to separate ideology from practicality .   the problem is in the yang gangs lack of critical analysis of yang's plans . UBI funded by VAT is the poor paying themselves , and also the rich , it's regressive as hell . it also does nothing to benefit those already receiving the bare minimum in SSI / SSDI   40 hour week , 48 weeks , that's a total of another $ 28k between 2 adults . Total projected income after UBI ? 52k . You not even gonna convince yourself that UBI isn't a better option .   UBI is great . UBI payed for by taxing consumption and eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism .   Again , if you were to criticize UBI , at least get your facts right . UBI does not eliminate any existing welfare programs .   allow me to correct my semantic error . UBI is great . YANG'S VERSION OF UBI payed for by taxing consumption and SLOWLY eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism .   Also funny how so suddenly people have always had an ideal version of UBI until confronted with Yang ‚Äô s , the only candidate to ever propose the policy and to essentially propel it into mainstream politics . Do you have a problem with the idea of human-centered capitalism ?"

The only retarded claim would be ‚Äò science is right . ‚Äô Actual scientists don ‚Äô t make that kind of claim . I think most logical people would claim that science is right in comparison to religion You are including such sciences as astrology in there , right ?  Since when was Astrology #scientific ? - seems you can't discern fact from fiction #HomeSchooling ?  astrology is a science . It's the study of space , galaxies and such ."

It doesn't matter  She's already accomplished everything there is to do as an artist . Now she's touring & making $ from her work  From the work she made in her prime . Not this new music she's trying with . It's just not good .  Who cares what you asked for ? You're constantly complaining over something that you don't have to listen too  It's like no one is allowed to have a different opinion of Mariah Carey . #Delusional  You can have your opinion but stop voicing them over and over and over when u see nothing it going to change  .

That helped Rep incumbents  well then I assume his clothing lines will start production on US soil .  fair enough , but voters gave the establishment chance after chance and were desperate for change . Nothing to lose  they gave Obama a chance by vowing to make him 1 term Pres & grind gov to halt , like that ?  establishment Republicans helped Obama pass health care and middle class only pays more for less . #agreetodisagree  well then just wait for its repeal and for drug prices to skyrocket ... what's the timeline for trickle down change ?  I see EpiPens costing $ 600 . As I said , lots of people saw nothing to lose . If nothing changes , pain continues  I guess we can't blame that on GOP obstruction , that would actually be based on logic and facts not feelings  GOP benefited from Trump coat tails . Dems ignored majority in Primary and went with Clinton and super delegates .

Find out more ‚¨á Ô∏è the church of england is so left wing and politically correct today that there is more chance they would ring their bells to pay respects to a dead terrorist than to support an important national occasion like Brexit .  If you think the CofE is left wing , you're in for a shock when you meet its founder ... ( Jesus , in case you thought I meant Henry VIII ... )    What nonsense . Church of England was founded by Henry VIII because Pope wouldn ‚Äô t grant him divorce . Re-writing history is totalitarian . The whole organisation is based on hypocrisy . To say otherwise is blatant denial of the truth .   John Every system and every model of behavioral governance is a human construct And every human has hypocrisy as a character trait Your glass house is missing a few windows ...   Eh ? You know nothing of my beliefs . Are you denying Henry didn't start his own church because RC church wouldn't grant him a divorce ? & make himself & his heirs & survivors head of that church , a role present monarch fills ? History books I've read wrong then ?   The original tweet was about Jesus . We won ‚Äô t worship Henry VIII . Your point is not relevant .   But Jesus didn't start Church of England . In fact Jesus didn't start any church , it was his disciples & followers . His fans in other words .   The church is simply a body of people who follow Christ . The fact the the CofE came about through a historical figure doesn ‚Äô t change the core beliefs or validity .   But the whole concept of it as a separate entity was founded on Henry 8 not getting divorce from Pope . It is a hypocritical sham .

MIsleading facts 101 , the mines labour "" closed "" was because A ) they ran out of coal or B ) they merged 2 mines into 1 so a mine was "" closed ""   I for one don ‚Äô t lament the passing of the days when we sent men deep underground in dark , dangerous and an health-injurious conditions to dig out fossil fuels . Yes it was desperately tough for those families affected but it was a grim industry that belonged in the past .   No I agree , the coal industry does belong in the past . The point is Thatcher ripped industry out of these communities and didn't offer any alternatives or training to the miners . Also it's not like we closed the mines for the environment we just imported the coal instead"

I ‚Äô d forgotten all about it , but today it surfaced while I was looking for something else . This is the first Feather I ever designed : a simple SAMD 11 board with mostly thru-hole components , because as of last summer I was still afraid of surface mount parts .   Fact : SMD is easier to solder than TH You don't need a microscope for 0805 and above  I made a mess of my first attempt . I can ; t understand how those small fiddly ( and very bridgeable ) legs are easier to solder ... then again ... I don't think I had the right kit for the job .  For me , a flux pen changed everything . With bridged pins you can add some flux and do kind of a sweeping motion with your iron away from the bridged spot ; seems to work like magic .   Flux is key for smd . Also if your iron can change tips , get a chisel tip or cut off cone type tip , the pointy tips are really awful for drag soldering ( a good term to google for some video tutorials , once you understand drag soldering , everything will be easy breezy )   I agree with everything has said , I just want to add I find the cut off cones type iron heads the easiest to use"

They rub or pat my arms with the cooing & baby voice . So it layers up the patronising with extra creepy & intrusive .   I was sat on a train platform minding my own business when a member of staff asked if I was ok , it ‚Äô s fine , it ‚Äô s their job . Before I could respond someone started taking over . Staff : are you ok ? Me : yeah fine thanks . Them : oh good I was just going to ask . Staff : are you with her ?   Oh my Lord ... when I was in Australia for Christmas I got the train to visit my cousin ... three times I was asked by a stranger if they could carry my bag for me ‚Äî nope ‚Äî a lady came up to me to ask me if people ever asked about my leg ‚Äî what ? ! ? ‚Äî many #Ableist moments that day üò£"
1, Really ? Trump is big league Libertarian ya know . #joking,"Donald Trump Says He May Keep Parts of Obama Health Care Act - The New York Times Trump wants to keep the preexisting conditions guarantee WITHOUT the individual mandate to spread costs ...... which would send the insurance industry into a death spiral . Trump didn't indicate price control for insurance on pre-existing conditions . High price would drop those people off . As would the shrinking , sicker risk pool from the youngest , healthiest ppl not getting policies without an individual mandate . maybe Trump will abandon IP system and de-regulate who can provide medical services and reform the education system for docs"
1,  They have the RIGHT to use climate porn descriptions they are the media !,"The world's oceans are now heating at the same rate as if five Hiroshima atomic bombs were dropped into the water every second , scientists have said  Now do the conversion of the sun hitting the earth in "" Hiroshima bombs "" . Maybe do our global energy usage in "" hiroshima-bombs "" . Or maybe , just maybe use Watts like normal people , and stop with the scare-mongering . Or maybe we should lobby for "" watts "" to be replaced by "" Hiroshima-bombs per second "" 1 HB / s = 84 TW And food should be marked with HB's not those pesky Cal's or Joules ."
1,.  You accuse me of being multiple people yet you have multiple twitter accounts . ,"That's nonsense , IMO . 17 , 18 , and 19 year olds can read this without it being a problem . Then again , my reasoning is that #teenagers swear anyways - even girls ! It's a #YAcliche that nobody ever said a bad word ..  Yeah , but personally , I could really do without the curse words . It makes intelligent characters sound less than . My very intelligent MC ,  , begs to differ . She swears occasionally to make her relate better , sound less elite ."
1, Of course ! And I've found atheists know more about the bible than most Christians .,"If Jesus was back among us , he'd be a law-abiding gun owner . He'd support the Police . And he'd say "" Merry Christmas "" not "" Happy Holidays . "".  Tell me where in the bible Jesus ever carried a weapon . Tell me where he expressed support of man-made laws . I'll wait . I wondered when my 6 years of catholic school would pay off .   I actually know the answer to this question , but I despise  , so I'm not helping . Heh . I'm an atheist , but if you're interested , I'll DM you the secret !"
0,  Same here  STM #Houston young priest on fire ! And some 1 mentioned to me he likes certain sodas and pistachios .

1,  This Is YOUR president back when Obama won # NotMyPresident #NeverTrump ,"Just had a very open and successful presidential election . Now professional protesters , incited by the media , are protesting . Very unfair ! The people of this country are speaking to you . It's your job to listen to them now . Stop tweeting and listen .  they are not speaking they're protesting democracy / fair election because their CROOK candidate lost   Why do all you Trumpers keep crowing it was fair when your candidate insisted it was rigged ?   He just said it was fair . Do you just pick & choose to believe what he says on any given day ? The Party that demanded Trump to accept the results , are now protesting / rioting the results . Twisted liberal sheep ."
0,Identify something you are doing for selfish reasons . How can Jesus make that into something pure and beautiful ? #Purify #Jesus #Faith,"Scripture : You are those who justify yourselves before men , but God knows your hearts . For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .

1, We get that you want to play nicey-nice with a fellow Mr Man who thinks it's OK discriminate bc you're not equal .,"  Yup , dig deep enough and you find him A-OK with Jim Crow . in neighborhoods hence why there was so much support for the Civil Rights Movement the people where ahead of their Govt . I think it's more regional--Deep South was not in favor of it . George Wallace ran a presidential campaign against it . the Civil Rights Movement and the American people who were behind it forcing the Govt to change its ways . Anyway , there is deep , deep division about suing bakers and photographers crap , and most ppl I know over here hate it . Dumb . I know it's like all groups you got fringe elements who take things to extreme and get everyone in that group looking bad Seriously . And then they sue you . Ok , i'm off , thanks for bridging divide with dignity and respect . Have a good day ."
1," "" you conservatives really don't know how to listen , huh .

1,   if you make a point faster it becomes more true,"Bar√ßa : have any team ever been in such a good position ( top of the league , in the CL last 16 , have best player in world ) and bad position ( coach a dead man walking , main striker out for 4 months , can't defend ) simultaneously ?
