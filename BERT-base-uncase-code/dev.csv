If not around Germany then at least in Bavaria . And if not in Bavaria then definitely in Bad Kissingen , a spa town . In 2017 Ukraine issued a warrant on Oleksandr Kondrashov . This is Kay Blankenburg , oberb√ºrgmeister of Bad Kissingen . He just signed a contract with sport maecenas to rent out local historic spa which budget heavily in disprofit . Kay is now in the hearts & mind of Ukrainians with his statement : "" The origin of the money is irrelevant "" . This is the spa in Bad Kissingen the oberb√ºrgmeister sold to a "" investor from Ukraine "" for ‚Ç¨ 230000 . The catch with the deal laid in the fact Bavarian pays heavy subsidies to local municipalities who get rid of unprofitable historic venues . After signing the contact Oleksandr Kondrashov was eager to give interviews and share the optimism of Bad Kissingen residents of bright future of the spa . Also he promised major international sports competition to the spa town . He appointed himself to the managed of the company that bought the spa . He also was the head of a company which was in charge of maintaining Oleksandr Kondrashov estate in northern Germany . Most importantly during the interviews he always reminded those great foreign competition for UNESCO worthy spa town can come ( only ) when they , German local municipality , will help him to get German living permit . For permit one has to be employed . The German Dream lasted for several weeks . Then Oleksandr Kondrashov took the matter to his own hands and closed down the historic SPA as the owner kicking out all the clubs from the ice rink there , including the city's famous ice hockey club . The shock was unbearable for the Germans as Bad Kissingen had to compete for Bad Kissingen cup in another city ice rink . Kids and their parents protested against such barbarity on the streets . They even had banners in Ukrainian demanding reopening . In reality he bought the unprofitable spa to have another company where he's a director to force several German officials to support his pleas to get living permit in Germany . That was the sole reason he made that move . The words of oberb√ºrgmeister : "" The origin of the money is irrelevant "" has all the potential to become a meme among Ukrainians . In fact it actually has been . German authorities arrested Oleksandr Kondrashov and he's in prison awaiting his possible extradition to Ukraine . He's a former Rada MP who made his wealth by swindling with gas transit money . ","I'm just full of tears after writing about this tragic story !This is Oleksandr Kondrashov .

0,"their conditioning , and most of all , nurture this love and not let it go . They must recognize the blessing , the miracle that it is to have found their other spiritual half . #life #spirituallove #sufilove","Life has many difficulties and many needs that one wants to fulfill . Some regrets and sorrows too from the past that one gets used to walking with , keeping company . But for someone who has lacked love and acceptance on so many levels all throughout life ,My life is complete with two things . First and foremost , someone that loves me as I am , unconditionally . Someone in whom I find a home in . My one true love . And second , my health so I can enjoy this life in love . Everything else is just background noise . If I have these twothings , I do not mourn the things lost , I do not fear whats to come , not even death . And I definitely do not fear failure , failure in anything . Because my every step leads to him . In my intoxication of my beloved , I don't even see myself falling and getting up repeatedly , I justproceed toward him in my drunken state . And I strongly believe that when you let this kind of love enter your life fully and unabashedly , you evolve as a human being , as a spiritual being , and when you've got a direct line to the divine , everything around you flourishes , blooms ,the good multiplies , abundance knocks at your door . This is one of the ways , for me personally being the superior way , to realize your full potential . When the masculine and the feminine come together in perfect harmony , without any hesitation or resistance , everything else fallsin place . But you must not resist this love for it requires you to disrobe the defense systems you've put in place . You must thank your survival instincts and put them aside . It is time to ascend . It requires you to let go of many things that hold you back but you are attachedto them nonetheless . They may have served you well in the past , but there is no need for them now . You must submit fully to this kind of love . Your whole life , as tragic as it may be , has lead you to this point . Be grateful for your tragedies especially .This type of love may overwhelm you and scare you at first . you may fear losing control . You may be miserable in your pangs of separation ( hijr ) . You may cry the sorrows of a lifetime . Did you think it was going to be easy , this all-encompassing love ? You do realize you had tobe cleansed of your patterns , of your set in stone thought systems , of your ego . You will definitely be miserable for a while . Like a seed , you must break down from the core to bring out the sacred Life in you . But there is a landfall at the other end of this deep turbulent oceanYou will reach a calm if you allow yourself to stop struggling & just let go . You will come to a point where you are fully present , fully aware of yourself . you'll see your beloved everywhere . How many times have you read , exploring different spiritual thoughts , how important itis to become a witness to self ? And you will , finally . You'll see yourself through your beloved's eyes . There is nothing you'll do , that will not be witnessed . you'll have fallen in love with yourself in exchange . They say , you must learn to love yourself in order to love anotherBut what if it can also be the other way around ? what if you learn t love and care fr yourself through your love for another . Is it so wrong ? It doesn't feel that way . I think this is one way to find God because true unadulterated love is just that , across the board . There are nolabels once it surpasses a certain depth . Ibaadat mein bhi nikhaar aayega . Your spiritual practice will come into clarity . For many of us , we must have some sort of spiritual practice / discipline / ritual ( whatever you want to call it ) in order to journey through this love , in orderto ascend and not fall . How is it that you can witness God through something sacred such as true love ? I think you can . It is possible that the deeper you go in love , the higher you rise to meet Eternity . But yes , I can see that some sort of ritual or practice is necessary tonot veer off or get distracted from the path of love . You may argue that such lovers only meet a tragic end . #sufilovers Yes , they do in stories that you hear . Would you read a story about a couple that lives together in love for the rest of their lives ? It would become justanother children's fairy tale . for a love story to shake you spiritually , it has to have a tragic end , namely death , to realize that it goes beyond this lifetime , death being just a stage . But there are lovers that live happily ever after . That old couple walking slowly beforeyou , supporting each other , the one sipping tea / coffee at the same cafe every day , the one that you read about that died within moments of each other , holding hands , or the young couple that finds solace and peace in each other's arms after a hard day's work . Any one of themcould be a divine / sacred couple . What did you think they walk around with halos above them ? or some spotlight shining on them ? not all enlightened souls become gurus and start giving discourses . many if not most , just live small , peaceful ( mostly ) , lives of domestic bliss as theygrow together through their conflicts and spiritually , live the mysteries of Life / Existence together hand in hand . having said all this , its sad that not everyone finds that one true love . It can't be just anyone . It can't be produced out of nothing . Somehow the whole universemust work together to bring two people together that belong together in such a way . It is by the grace of God that these two find each other journeying through lifetimes .

0,Expose yourself to the right influence ‚Äì make sure right influence is what is at work in your life ‚Äì be exposed to the right things . . . . . #NewBeginnings #TimeForAMakeover #Life,"New Beginnings can be made manifest in all areas of one ‚Äô s life when we engage the word of God . The power to transform is in the word of God . #AThread To have a new beginning we need to think about it from the point of a new life , for us to have a new life we must have new thinking because change starts from within . How do you change from within and recognize critical conjunctures in destiny ? -- You have to see it from the standpoint of the supernatural . Change ‚Äì a real makeover ‚Äì starts from within ‚Äì it is important for us to know that our internal structure ( what we want to change ) is formed through nature and nurture -‚Äì they are products of both our genetic code ( DNA ) and our environment . We can ‚Äô t do anything about our DNA , what we have been through , where we grew up and whatever influence came from there but when there is a working of the spirit from within , our internal structure can change- From birth different forces try to determine your internal composition . Thought patterns , Belief systems , Attitude ‚Äì What you meditate on internally is what would manifest externally -- Diet ‚Äì what are you ingesting ‚Äì what is being said or modeled to you ? What enters your heart that you accept ? What are you repulsed by that you reject ? Emotions ‚Äì feeling fearful , depressed and overwhelmed will affect the way you live Can we really change ? -- We can ‚Äô t change our DNA but if we can allow the holy spirit to work in our lives those things will no longer affect our decision in life .

May today be the DAY His heart directs us in everything we do & say forever going forward ... Ezek . 36:26 Suppose  ever listens ? Thou shall not bear false witness . Thou shall not steal . Thou shall not covet thy neighbor . Remember ? Supposedly you were raised that way . What happened ?

1,"  Ohh , so close , but the correct answer was , "" What is .

No one is going to take all the guns . Believing they'll try is idiotic . Common sense control is a must .   But every proposal affects only the law-abiding , and does next to nothing to stop criminals . Universal background checks ? Long waiting periods ? Criminals can still steal guns or buy them on the black market . "" Assault weapon "" bans ? Ineffective at saving lives . What's your idea ?   And what we're doing now is saving lives and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals ? ?   Yes , violent crime is trending downwards . But I agree that more should be done to stop dangerous people . Widespread education on safe storage of firearms and the importance of theft prevention would be helpful . But people don't want gun education in schools .   We could allow the general public to access the NICS background check system so they can verify who they're selling a gun to without paying a gun dealer to run the check for them . But nobody has proposed that .   It depends on the dealer . Around me , it's usually around $ 25-30 . Add in the time and hassle of butter and seller finding a gun store that's open at a time convenient to both , and an unfortunate number of people might just say "" Eh , I'm sure you're fine "" and selling the gun .   Then it would be an illegal sale if 100 % background checks become law .   It's an illegal sale anyways , because it's illegal for a criminal to buy guns . That's why they steal them ( which is illegal ) , or use straw purchasers ( which is also illegal ) . You could pass 100 % background check laws , but it will only affect people who obey the law anyway .   It would flag people with mental health issues , domestic violence arrests , etc .    It could , but it could fail , too . Especially when people just don't obey the law . That's why I prefer giving people other than gun dealers access to NICS checks . It's not a burden on the law-abiding , but it will give them the ability to avoid selling to anyone who is prohibited . The Aurora , Illinois shooter was a prohibited possessor , yet he was abled to buy a gun at a store because NICS failed . Also , the vast majority of criminals obtained their guns through theft or the black market .  Last night my wife's car failed to start and she called be for help . I told her that if it failed once , then it's useless . Don't try and fix it .

I assume you like disney , nuna ? yes , i am a fan of disney especially disney classic üíï which disney character is your favorite chenle ? I don't have any specific character that I like but I have watched Frozen and I like it ! Who is your favorite character , nuna ? I guess it's Mulan .. ? ah frozen . no , my favorite one is rapunzel from tangled . but i adore alice too ... i can't choose . You must really like Disney , then . Have you ever go to the Disneyland ? i ever went there once , japan disneyland and i want to visit it again because the place is just so great ! Disneyland is a great place but .. You basically went there for waiting [ sighs ] . People usually spent 10 hours in disneyland . 2 hours of playing and the rest of the 8 hours ? Waiting üòÇ i couldn't more agree than this . it's indeed a crowded place and we basically just take some picture there üòÇ And the ticket is also so expensive ! But still , the place is sure pretty and has this magical feeling right about that . i want to go there again but i am so broken and jobless . let's go there together later , your treat üòõ I'm sure you're not jobless nuna ! You must be busy , right ? not really busy . i just have a monthly schedule though , how sad :[ . But still that means you're busy doing something and not only lazy-ing around at the dorm :D Don't be sad , nuna ! you're right i need to add up my bank account though . actually i am busy trying to attrack nina but she never pay attention to me even after i give her a massage on her tummy . A massage .. on her tummy ? Is she pregnant or something .."

0, You are an awesome human being . This will stay with them as will you . #faith #DoingTheRightThing,"The young woman was speaking thru a Mandarin interpreter . She started walking back toward the jail cells . Officers turned her around & pointed to freedom . Head down she walked out of court . Turned around to students . Riveted . I pointed out a couple of things from those 2 minutes :1 . Notice how she had her retinas scanned before she was brought up ? State surveillance . 2 . Most charged w / prostitution are sex workers who want agency or human trafficking victims . Why arrest / prosecute at all ? 3 . 9/10 judges would have granted dismissal . Justice is arbitrary .I know theyre 5th graders . But responses & thoughtfulness earlier earned real talk on difficult subjects . They got it . "" Jail doesn't help people that are already victims . "" "" But she [ the judge ] seemed so nice earlier . "" "" What happens now ? "" Hands raising right & left . But next case :Man charged w / assault in second degree . Prosecution consented to his release . Lessons : * Prosecutors have a lot of power . * When they decide to let someone to go home , judge will release them . Doesn't matter the charges . They could stop pretrial detention today if they wanted to .Hand raised . Girl who hadnt spoken . "" The ppl really seem to like their public defenders . "" Told them how impt it is to build trust w / ppl you represent & vice-versa . How everyone has so much in common w / each other even if we couldnt seem more different . How difficult it often is .Young girl lead out next . Robbery charge for stealing jewelry from cousin during fight . Prosecution again consents to release ( good on them ) . But requests , as always , a stay away order . Colleague raises issues that may arise at family functions .

So post 1964 CRA what were the biggest flips . I'll go first . Storm Thurmond . Your turn .  You are still not answering my question . I know all of this . Why do most PoC vote Dem now ?  Because they have been brainwashed by a lie of "" institutional racism "" Dems cultivate that nonsense .  No ! It is not a lie . And the fact that you believe this is incredibly sad .  Oh my god , this is exhausting . It's like arguing with my dad .  I thought it'd be an easy question . My apologies .  Wait , do you think institutional racism means , the CIA is racist ? ! How about the institution of the USA ?  So what institution is racist ? Labeling 330 million people racist is well , racist .  Think of the USA as an institution . It's a govt . so , it is one ."

0, Consider how powerless Job ended up before #God . That passage is for a strong person like Job to #endure . I have found that #Christ has an ability to turn to . This can be very empowering to survivors in emotional wildernesses . ,"This is how children are protected ... good strong men w / moral fortitude , who are willing to do the right thing , and stand against Predatory practices !  Do you have an opinion about male circumcision in the USA ? I take a historical Judeo-Christian perspective on male circumcision . It seems to be frowned upon in modern Men's Rights circles . The Bible speaks highly & preferentially of a "" Circumcision of the Heart "" . Is there a medical case still supporting a public health narrative ?  Speaking specifically to the verse you referenced , from a Christian perspective , it doesn't carry the same requirements / connotation as it did for the Jews . However , I am persuaded that the Lord had a lot in mind when he instituted male circumcision . So , I do believe in it . Paul , who was himself a Jewish pharisee at one point , addressed the practice at length ( no pun intended ) in some of his writings .  Likely , the closest thing we as Christians grapple w / , that might raise similar internal struggles , is w / giving , communion , the amt . of church attendance , & baptism . Though we're not under law , it's still important to discern the principles involved so we can be led by the Lord . The apostles fought about the subject at times ( Galatians 2 ) . I believe that some people even consider it as type of mark Jews use to signify gentile fealty . There is even debate within psychology as to the merits of male circumcision .  I am aware that there is a movement to ban the practice . As a dad , it was emotionally painful to have my infant boys go through the procedure . But , that is a belief I hold ... that the Lord initiated a practice that held true for 6000 yrs , so it likely is important to practice . Just being aware of little conflicts of conscience , empathy with other males , & ideas that the practice is culturally & spiritually significant is valuable . I had an enlightening experience investigating relationships between #circumcision & #baptism .  I think that is vital , if we are to mature . Grace gives us freedom to follow an informed conscience . Hence , as Peter said in 2 Pet 3:18 , we need to grow in both grace and knowledge , which is accomplished by maturity & growth ( 2 Pet 1:3- 8) . We can trust the Lord can mature others . It's just that easy to find intersectionality in psychology & religon . üòÅ Self actualization is built into many theological frameworks ! Free will , both produces & removes anxiety ! How often is trust central to trauma-work ? All the time . Trust in God can be a hurdle for survivors . "" Self-actualization "" is different for Christians vs . non . For Christians , it is Christ-likeness , leading to holiness . For others , it is self-fulfillment & happiness . Grieving is central to the healing process , which requires one to wrestle w / the big issues , as in the bk of Job ."," Consider how powerless Job ended up before #God . That passage is for a strong person like Job to #endure . I have found that #Christ has an ability to turn to . This can be very empowering to survivors in emotional wildernesses . This is how children are protected ... good strong men w / moral fortitude , who are willing to do the right thing , and stand against Predatory practices !  Do you have an opinion about male circumcision in the USA ? I take a historical Judeo-Christian perspective on male circumcision . It seems to be frowned upon in modern Men's Rights circles . The Bible speaks highly & preferentially of a "" Circumcision of the Heart "" . Is there a medical case still supporting a public health narrative ?  Speaking specifically to the verse you referenced , from a Christian perspective , it doesn't carry the same requirements / connotation as it did for the Jews . However , I am persuaded that the Lord had a lot in mind when he instituted male circumcision . So , I do believe in it . Paul , who was himself a Jewish pharisee at one point , addressed the practice at length ( no pun intended ) in some of his writings .  Likely , the closest thing we as Christians grapple w / , that might raise similar internal struggles , is w / giving , communion , the amt . of church attendance , & baptism . Though we're not under law , it's still important to discern the principles involved so we can be led by the Lord . The apostles fought about the subject at times ( Galatians 2 ) . I believe that some people even consider it as type of mark Jews use to signify gentile fealty . There is even debate within psychology as to the merits of male circumcision .  I am aware that there is a movement to ban the practice . As a dad , it was emotionally painful to have my infant boys go through the procedure . But , that is a belief I hold ... that the Lord initiated a practice that held true for 6000 yrs , so it likely is important to practice . Just being aware of little conflicts of conscience , empathy with other males , & ideas that the practice is culturally & spiritually significant is valuable . I had an enlightening experience investigating relationships between #circumcision & #baptism .  I think that is vital , if we are to mature . Grace gives us freedom to follow an informed conscience . Hence , as Peter said in 2 Pet 3:18 , we need to grow in both grace and knowledge , which is accomplished by maturity & growth ( 2 Pet 1:3- 8) . We can trust the Lord can mature others . It's just that easy to find intersectionality in psychology & religon . üòÅ Self actualization is built into many theological frameworks ! Free will , both produces & removes anxiety ! How often is trust central to trauma-work ? All the time . Trust in God can be a hurdle for survivors . "" Self-actualization "" is different for Christians vs . non . For Christians , it is Christ-likeness , leading to holiness . For others , it is self-fulfillment & happiness . Grieving is central to the healing process , which requires one to wrestle w / the big issues , as in the bk of Job ."

1,   Because that is democracy . The voters are entitled to know EXACTLY where the top candidates in the race stand on the issues . Christy is just afraid of being called out on specific policies . She doesn't want to defend her record . Sounds like the recipe for a great rep," Too many vegetables on that table ‚Ä¶ You need some protein , stat .  Who cares about what's on the table ? You just keep ignoring the fact that she was selling herself to big donors for 8 hours . :D  Actually , no ... she was calling individual donors . Ordinary folks who live in the district , which might be why you didn ‚Äô t get a call . It ‚Äô s called phone banking , it ‚Äô s a normal part of running for office . You guys are so focused on his talking pts , you ‚Äô re missing the truth .   That would be much easier to believe if Christy's past contributions weren't so large and driven by party funding and large contributions . Based on the endorsements that she rolls out , she at best is calling for those and at worst dialing for dollars with big donors .   No extremely ignorant rebuke attempts ? Average 2700 per donor in the last two years I ‚Äô m sure was from everyday working people . You are such a joke .   Ignorant ? Ignorance belongs to those who continue to ascribe numbers from an extremely contentious Assembly race against a vile mysoginist sexist opponent ( I can see your confusion ) while working overtime to flip a red district to blue . It worked , in spite of progressive ‚Äú input . ‚Äù   Smearing maliciously by manipulating context , human nature , and the concept of redemption make you into the first class troll you are today . Thank you for helping the progressive movement grow . For every one of your inane comments there dozens of replies proving your fakeness .   Fake ? I ‚Äô m an actual voter in #CA25 , can you say the same ?   Fake when it comes down to your motives . You reek of ulterior ones .   Defending a candidate with thousands of dollars average on individual donations vs one that is 27 bucks is the biggest red flag ever .   That statement merely shows your complete lack of knowledge about this district . And your complete ability to be snowed by a national power grab . Your guy isn ‚Äô t for this district , he is for himself . His national profile allows him to get small donations while she works harder .   And you are an absolute moron for not believing issues are much bigger than your forced attempts at nativism for the rich and their brown nosers , which requires a national even international working class movement to fix .   And you are a moron for believing that a loudmouth YouTube host has the best interest of MY district at heart , as opposed to trying to build his national profile . Note : we are smarter than that . Check the history of this district , we repel carpetbaggers .   You are right he has the best interest of the nation and the bona fides to achieve it instead of being alt centrist shills like your kind .   Perhaps he should run for Senate then . I hear he believes Kamala Harris is defeatable . There ‚Äô s no way he wins ... and I ‚Äô ll be amazed if he makes Top 2 ...   But you ‚Äô re right , you vote for your guy , I ‚Äô ll vote for mine ... we ‚Äô ll see how it turns out . You are registered to vote here , right ?   How thick are you ? Fighting for a paradigm shift is built on local votes to achieve much higher prosperity for the workers everywhere and to address the income inequality you love championing . Stop trying to distract from the local issues that are intrinsic to the national ones .   Again : 1 ) tell him to run for Senate 2 ) tell him to run against in his home district 3 ) tell him to move here and run here in 2 years , when he has contributed to this community 4 ) vote for him , I won ‚Äô t be , so he needs you   Not to mention that there should be a debate on the issues between these candidates . CA25 voters need to know where Christy and Cenk stand on issues and how they respond to policy questions . The voters deserve that but Christy is MIA . Sound democratic ? Hell no !   Why ? So bandstand boy can go off and yell about the things that he will have NO input on , even if he somehow wins the election ?

Ignorance belongs to those who continue to ascribe numbers from an extremely contentious Assembly race against a vile mysoginist sexist opponent ( I can see your confusion ) while working overtime to flip a red district to blue . It worked , in spite of progressive ‚Äú input . ‚Äù   Smearing maliciously by manipulating context , human nature , and the concept of redemption make you into the first class troll you are today . Thank you for helping the progressive movement grow . For every one of your inane comments there dozens of replies proving your fakeness .   Fake ? I ‚Äô m an actual voter in #CA25 , can you say the same ?   Fake when it comes down to your motives . You reek of ulterior ones .   Defending a candidate with thousands of dollars average on individual donations vs one that is 27 bucks is the biggest red flag ever .   That statement merely shows your complete lack of knowledge about this district . And your complete ability to be snowed by a national power grab . Your guy isn ‚Äô t for this district , he is for himself . His national profile allows him to get small donations while she works harder .   And you are an absolute moron for not believing issues are much bigger than your forced attempts at nativism for the rich and their brown nosers , which requires a national even international working class movement to fix .   And you are a moron for believing that a loudmouth YouTube host has the best interest of MY district at heart , as opposed to trying to build his national profile . Note : we are smarter than that . Check the history of this district , we repel carpetbaggers .   You are right he has the best interest of the nation and the bona fides to achieve it instead of being alt centrist shills like your kind .   Perhaps he should run for Senate then . I hear he believes Kamala Harris is defeatable . There ‚Äô s no way he wins ... and I ‚Äô ll be amazed if he makes Top 2 ...   But you ‚Äô re right , you vote for your guy , I ‚Äô ll vote for mine ... we ‚Äô ll see how it turns out . You are registered to vote here , right ?   How thick are you ? Fighting for a paradigm shift is built on local votes to achieve much higher prosperity for the workers everywhere and to address the income inequality you love championing . Stop trying to distract from the local issues that are intrinsic to the national ones .   Again : 1 ) tell him to run for Senate 2 ) tell him to run against in his home district 3 ) tell him to move here and run here in 2 years , when he has contributed to this community 4 ) vote for him , I won ‚Äô t be , so he needs you   Not to mention that there should be a debate on the issues between these candidates . CA25 voters need to know where Christy and Cenk stand on issues and how they respond to policy questions . The voters deserve that but Christy is MIA . Sound democratic ? Hell no !   Why ? So bandstand boy can go off and yell about the things that he will have NO input on , even if he somehow wins the election ? CA25 knows where she stands ... same place she has for the last 10 + years as an elected official and her entire life ... with this district ... her home ."

I suggest you listen to every thing he ‚Äô s said at rallies , in pressers , in interviews - - you decide what ‚Äô s on the problematic language . If you ‚Äô re unable to do that , I ‚Äô m guessing you don ‚Äô t want to hear / see but ignore / excuse .   Trump is not using Orwell the media is  tRUmp is trying to relive a time when disparaging those folks he thought were ‚Äò lesser ‚Äô than he could be treated this way and it was accepted .

If you haven ‚Äô t heard anything tRUmp ‚Äô s said / done as immoral or as indecent then there ‚Äô s nothing I ‚Äô ll tweet that will make a difference to you  Cause you can ‚Äô t .

Reporter asked a simple question , as president you answer questions , tRUmp ‚Äô s response - uncalled for , that wasn ‚Äô t punching back that was an asinine reaction to a simple question a reporter asked . As president , tRUmp sets the tone , he ‚Äô s diminished the office .  Please just stop it Obama has done that and Pelosi just chastised the press for asking a question she said she wasn ‚Äô t talking about  tRUmp has diminished the office of the presidency by not doing his HW , taking putin ‚Äô s word on issues of national security .

I just love the liberal MSM and politicians who yell and scream Trump is a racists but defend people who were caught wearing blackface  As a POC , not as a liberal , the fact that folks even thought wearing ‚Äú blackface ‚Äù was a good idea leads me to smh and wonder about their opinions of black / brown people , in general - that ‚Äô s all I got - stupid is as stupid does .  Just stop I lived through busing & race wars in the ‚Äú 60 ‚Äô s but in the end of the 70 ‚Äô s it got better in the 80 ‚Äô s it was way better but then Soros got a hold of the Dem ‚Äô s in 2008 and showed them to divide the country and Obama ‚Äô s rhetoric took us back to the 60 ‚Äô s everything is racist","  What ‚Äò rhetoric ‚Äô are you speaking of , a man reminding US he ‚Äô s a man of color who wears his skin 365/24 / 7 [ IOW , it is part of who he is ] , that wasn ‚Äô t rhetoric , that ‚Äô s reality . Maybe , folks wanted that to fade away so we could sing kumbaya  No , the whistleblower IS NOT a key witness but he did ‚Äò blow the lid off ‚Äô WH shenanigans . True key witnesses re 7/25 / 19 phone call [ they knew stuff ] #Mulvaney #Bolton #Pompeo and in related matters  So he ‚Äô s not a key witness but he blew the lid ? Listen it all start with this idiot who heard someone ‚Äô s opinion of is interpretation of someone else ! Only liberal democrats would think a 3rd party gossip would be fact  No , it didn ‚Äô t start w ‚Äú that idiot ‚Äù but it began w ‚Äú other idiot currently occupying the WH ‚Äù withholding the aid to Ukraine , a violation of Impoundment Control Act . Phone call happened 9:03 AM -9:33 AM , at 11:04 AM OMB ‚Äô s Duffey sent email that hold was placed .  U think he ‚Äô s an idiot cause that ‚Äô s all you ‚Äô ve heard from every network or politician , you don ‚Äô t have your own opinion other then what you here you ‚Äô re close minded and it ‚Äô s sad  I ‚Äô ve heard what he ‚Äô s said [ word salads of nonsense ] , how he acts [ disparaging this one , making fun of another one ] , having nothing to do w PC-free behavior [ acts / sounds like the idiot he is on full display ] AND I ‚Äô ve come to that conclusion all by my lonesome . #TYVM  So what did he say that disturbed you so much  Dude , There ‚Äô s so much to choose from . I suggest you listen to every thing he ‚Äô s said at rallies , in pressers , in interviews - - you decide what ‚Äô s on the problematic language . If you ‚Äô re unable to do that , I ‚Äô m guessing you don ‚Äô t want to hear / see but ignore / excuse .   Trump is not using Orwell the media is  tRUmp is trying to relive a time when disparaging those folks he thought were ‚Äò lesser ‚Äô than he could be treated this way and it was accepted . Counterpunches , hits back at everything even when not reacting would make people forget about it . Can ‚Äô t help himself .  You still haven ‚Äô t said what horrible thing he has said , that is destroying this country or some racist thing he has said , so until I hear what you thing he has said you may as will yell at the moon  You do your own listening and hearing , I will not provide that substance for you to pick apart and argue with me about . If you haven ‚Äô t heard anything tRUmp ‚Äô s said / done as immoral or as indecent then there ‚Äô s nothing I ‚Äô ll tweet that will make a difference to you  Cause you can ‚Äô t . It ‚Äô s not about providing it ‚Äô s about you can ‚Äô t  * * * Just to humor you * * * 1 ) making fun of disabled reporter 2 ) calling NFL players SOBs 3 ) name calling to any 1 who disagrees w him 4 ) causing deaths by not providing adequate care to those , incl children , in detention 5 ) acting more like a petulant 7yo than potus .  1 , reporter attacked him 1st but that ‚Äô s no excuse 2 they disrespected our flag but 1 isn ‚Äô t ok for U but 2 is ?  Reporter asked a simple question , as president you answer questions , tRUmp ‚Äô s response - uncalled for , that wasn ‚Äô t punching back that was an asinine reaction to a simple question a reporter asked . As president , tRUmp sets the tone , he ‚Äô s diminished the office .  Please just stop it Obama has done that and Pelosi just chastised the press for asking a question she said she wasn ‚Äô t talking about  tRUmp has diminished the office of the presidency by not doing his HW , taking putin ‚Äô s word on issues of national security .

1, Yes make Trek to be mindless ubiquity commodities and not something generations are inspired by or have any serious impact on society . That must be what CBS wants out of Star Trek these days .,"A short thread regarding #StarTrek #ShortTreks .

If they were to make more of these , one for each series say , but not count them as canon . 1/3Simply sell them all as one offs celebrating the many decades of #StarTrek ... Would this work better for you ?
